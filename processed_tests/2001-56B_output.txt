First, the turf should go. There should be nothing artificial about baseball, least of all the grass. The odd green shade of artificial turf is a poor counterfeit of grass green. When my sons and I visit the ballpark we are essential on a picnic. Why gather around a carpet, in which we can do just as well at home, to enjoy our hot dogs, peanuts, and sodas?

Second, the dome should go. While it’s true that the dome blocks out rain, it also blocks out the sun and sky. Baseball is a pastoral sport, where players lope across the field, where a strong player can smack a ball seemingly to the sky. Under a dome, the game is hermetically sealed, the players’ skins look sickly, and the hit ball is in danger of banging a rafter. Finally, I want my sons to be closer to the game. I don’t want us to be forced to the edge of a bowled stadium, like the remnants of unwanted cereal. I want us to hear the ball slapping the catcher’s mitt, and the shortstop yelling “I got it!” when the ball is popped up in the infield. Let us study an outfielder's face, without the aid of binoculars. When he’s sprinting toward the infield to catch a short fly ball.

Kermit the Frog should be proud. At long last
North America is learning what the famous amphibian
has lamented for years: It’s not easy being green.

The greening of our society has surpassed the
media trend phase, and has taken root in our culture as
a permanent imperative, an ongoing reality that will
affect every facet of our society.

When even corporate America takes (at least the
rhetoric of) environmentalism to heart we can be confident
that the movement has been firmly entrenched.
When a corporate juggernaut like Procter & Gamble
flies executives to a Victoria, B.C., city council
meeting to beg that their disposable diapers not be
banned from local landfills; and then offers to donate
$100,000 in seed money to the city’s composting program,
we can be certain that green will be around as long as
greenbacks.

But a disturbing pattern has developed within the
movement as it grows. The pattern goes like this: scientists
forecast a specific cataclysm (ozone depletion, global
warming, rampant deforestation); the mass media
disseminates the information (inevitably oversimplifying
things); public reacts with shock and demands answers;
the media redoes the story with household tips to prevent
said cataclysm; corporate sector and finally government
present “friendly” (band-aid) programs to slow down the
inevitable; media drops the subject; public relaxes;
scientists announce a new calamity . . . and the merry jig
goes on.

There are many drawbacks to this sort of feedback
loop, not the least being that each successive crisis
brings us closer to a jaded, “quit crying wolf” attitude.
Our problem lies in the nature of reaction itself.
Because environmental problems are so often presented
in an air of crisis, we lose the opportunity to calmly
examine the source of the problems. When we do
explore the reasons behind ecological threats, we delve
no further than learning that, say, fluorocarbons from
aerosols deplete upper atmosphere ozone. Rarely, if
ever, do we face the fact that all these impending natural
disasters stem from the same man-made source. All
our specific little solutions make us miss the point of
the problem as a whole. Virtuous consumption,
bringing home CFC-free deodorant spray in a
biodegradable plastic bag, diverts our attention from
the true source of our environmental woes—consumption
itself.

Our culture’s highest aim, some would argue our
only aim, is to grow, to consume. Industrial and
commercial growth are the measures of our nation’s
strength. Our work ethic has been so twisted and
mutated that even language reflects that our dearest
wish for ourselves is to grow, to be productive, and to
consume.

This has not always been the case. As social critic
Stuart Ewen recently noted, “Up until the 17th century,
‘consumption’ had a negative connotation, essentially
it’s about destruction.” Later, during the 17th and 18th
centuries, consumption gained a neutral sense in
describing the new marketplace economics. By the 20th
century consumerism and consumption were being
exalted.

“To be a consumer is what we are,” says Ewen.
“Consumption is the ideal we seek. Unfortunately, it is
still what it meant before the 17th century. A consumption-based
economy is an economy driven by waste . . .
and therefore constant buying and disposing of goods
starts clouding the environment, starts destroying the
ozone layer, starts filling the waters that sustain us with
garbage . . . making life on earth impossible. Then we
have to realize that consumption as a way of life has to
be thrown into question.”

But when our ancestors prayed and worked for
growth and productivity they didn’t have material gain
as their only aim. Growth could also be gained in
spiritual, educational and other realms. Somehow, some-
where, we lost sight of what success means and
fashioned in its place a glorious, shining future where
bigger is better, new is good, and old is to be replaced
as quickly as possible. I don’t think our forefathers and
mothers would be satisfied with our fifty varieties of
cereal, our traffic jams, our undisposable nuclear waste,
and our landfills full of disposable diapers. Impressed?
Yes. Horrified? Maybe. Satisfied? I doubt it. Even
without knowing of the ecological drawbacks, they
would probably say we are making pigs of ourselves:
wasting far more than we use; and using much, much
more than we need.

According to the passage, today’s society judges our
nation’s strength by which of the following criteria?

D. Industrial and commercial growth

The passage suggests that environmentally conscious
behaviors like using biodegradable plastic bags and
CFC-free deodorant:

F. cannot change the face of American business practice.HUMANITIES
This passage is adapted from Audreen Buffalo's article “Sweet Honey: A Cappella Activists,” which appeared in Ms. magazine (©1993 by Lang Communications, Inc.).
In 1973, Bernice Johnson Reagon, vocal director of the D.C. Black Repertory Theater, was urged by members of the Washington, D.C.-based company to organize a singing group. Sweet Honey in the Rock was the happy result. Using the original instrument—the human voice—aided only by shekere, tambourine, and microphone, the ensemble has built a reputation as the world’s premier female a cappella ensemble [a group that sings without musical instruments accompanying it).
In helping birth Sweet Honey, Reagon brought sure knowledge of music’s informational and transformative power to the task. Her musical mission is rooted in the rural southern church pastored by her father. “For the first 11 years, our church had no piano, and I’m still an a cappella singer. I grew up singing in the nineteenth-century congregational tradition—a style that can be traced to Africa.”
In describing that tradition Reagon says: “Spontaneity is one of the characteristics that mark congregational singing. Singers create as they go along. Although a leader introduces the song, there is no solo tradition. Once the song is raised, the group joins and the creation becomes collaborative. You must be open to what will happen to the song and you in performance.”
Reagon’s life continues to be informed by the Georgia community into which she was born and her early civil rights activism with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She, Rutha Mae Harris, Cordell Reagon, and Charles Neblett were members of the SNCC Freedom Singers. Appearing at hundreds of freedom rallies and mass meetings during the early 1960s, they were the movement’s singing newspaper—reporting and defining the actions and issues from the civil rights war zones where they were frequently arrested. In many ways her mission has not changed.
Spirituality, consciousness-raising, social responsibility, healing, and—most of all—love resonate at the heart of Sweet Honey’s repertoire. Songs such as “Patchwork Quilt,” “Are My Hands Clean?” and the Grammy-nominated “Emergency,” address AIDS, worker and environmental exploitation, and racism.
The first song Reagon taught the group was one she’d never sung but remembered from her youth, “Sweet Honey in the Rock.” “When I asked my father about its meaning, he said it was a parable that referred to a land where, when rocks were cracked, honey would flow from them.” Reagon came to interpret this as a metaphor for the legacy of African American women in the United States. Within many African traditions rocks are considered living spirits. “So too, sometimes, we, black women, have had to have the standing power of rocks and of mountains—cold and hard, strong and stationary. That quality has often obscured the fact that inside the strength, partnering the sturdiness, we are as honey. If our world is warm, honey flows and so do we. If it is cold, stiff, and stays put—so do we.”
Reagon, Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade Casel, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahlil, and Carol Maillard are the women who currently compose the musical collective. Over the years’ more than 20 singers have been members of the group.
The group meets, in the ancient way of women, communally. Each is aware of the others’ unique contributions. Each serves as a master teacher in at least one repertoire or singing style and apprentices in an area covered by another member. They write, produce, discuss points of view, and develop ideas for songs and treatments.
The fluid communal spirit of the group is manifest in every performance.
“People who respond so enthusiastically to Sweet Honey hear their own inner echo. They hear their names called, their thoughts confirmed,” says Reagon.
“After a Sweet Honey performance, people often ask, ‘Why do I feel so good after hearing songs that deal with issues I usually find paralyzing to think about?’
“Life’s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they’re supposed to help you discover who you are. They’re the prod that moves you forward.
“The civil rights movement was the most wonderful thing I experienced in my life,” Reagon muses.
“Day by day, I found courage to be who I was. Finding courage. Taking the risk. There was something about doing things that I had always been warned would kill or ruin you. Well, I did get suspended and I did go to jail—things I had been told to avoid at all costs. But I found that if you avoided everything that was a risk, there would be many things you’d never know about yourself.”

21. Reagon indicates that her experience in the civil rights movement made her more:
A. resentful.
B. serious.
C. confident.
D. social.

27. It may be reasonably inferred that the author’s main purpose in writing this passage was to describe:
A. the accomplishments of Bernice Johnson Reagon and how she has influenced the group Sweet Honey in the Rock.
B. how the group Sweet Honey in the Rock worked hard to become the world’s premier female a cappella ensemble.
C. how female artists, such as those in Sweet Honey in the Rock, often have a difficult time becoming successful.
D. the effect the civil rights movement had on Bernice Johnson Reagon, both personally and professionally.

22. Reagon’s remarks in lines 74-76 most strongly indicate that:
F. the audience appreciates the variety of talents in the group.
G. people in the audience learn new ideas from the group.
H. the group encourages the audience to participate in their songs.
J. people in the audience relate to the group’s message.

23. The passage suggests that Reagon began singing a cappella because:
A. it was the style of the SNCC Freedom Singers.
B. the D.C. Black Repertory Theater wanted her to.
C. there were no musical instruments in her church.
D. she wanted to honor African traditions.

28. In the third paragraph (lines 19-26), Reagon most strongly suggests that congregational singing requires singers to be:
F. methodical.
G. determined.
H. adaptable.
J. inspirational.

29. One of the main points Reagon makes in her comments in lines 53-59 is that:
A. the most admirable people are those who can be strong and stationary.
B. the best way for people to learn about themselves is to have the standing power of rocks.
C. people should make every effort to avoid risks.

Students debate 4 hypotheses regarding the Moon’s
origin, based on the following observations.

Observations

Observation 1 — Earth and the Moon have the same
proportions of various oxygen isotopes (forms of
oxygen).

Observation 2 — The same minerals that compose ter-
restrial lavas are also found in lunar lava specimens.

Observation 3 — The Moon contains little or no water.

Observation 4 — Earth contains a much higher per-
centage of iron than does the Moon.

Observation 5 — Fossil records show that the length of
Earth’s day used to be shorter.

larities. The Moon and Earth probably formed within the
same cloud of gas and dust, when large clumps of gas and
dust in the cloud gravitationally attracted additional mate-
rials from the cloud. (The collapse of clouds of gas and
dust also results in the formation of stars.)

Hypothesis 4

The Moon most likely came from somewhere in the
solar system far from Earth. As the Moon approached
Earth, it was attracted more strongly by Earth’s gravita-
tional field. Although the Moon speeded up as it
approached Earth, it was not moving fast enough as it
passed Earth to escape Earth’s gravity. Consequently, it
entered into orbit around Earth.

1. According to Hypothesis 2, the origin of most of the
matter composing the Moon was most likely which of
the following objects?

F. A star far from the Sun

Observation 6 — Collisions between Mars and other a iota
objects have resulted in the ejection of material from D. The Sun

Mars’s surface. Some of the ejected material has
reached Earth.

Hypothesis I

All of the material that formed the Moon came from
Earth. The rate of Earth’s spin on its axis was high enough
at one time to eject material from Earth’s surface. This
material was unable to escape Earth’s gravity and went into
orbit around Earth, forming the Moon.

Hypothesis 2

The material that composes the Moon came mostly
from Earth’s surface. A large object from another part of
the solar system collided with Earth and threw the surface
material into orbit around Earth. Some of the differences in
composition between Earth and the Moon might be
accounted for by the composition of matter from the large
object.

Hypothesis 3

The Moon was never a part of Earth, because Earth’s
and the Moon’s chemical compositions have too few simi-

2. Supporters of Hypothesis 1 would most likely agree
that at the time the Moon formed, the rotation rate of
Earth on its axis was:

F. fewer than | rotation per year.

G. 100 rotations per year.

H. 365 rotations per year.

J. many more than 365 rotations per year.

Suppose that supporters of Hypothesis 2 suggested that
the Moon contained a significant amount of water
when it was first formed. Which of the following state-
ments about the Moon’s water content would be most
consistent with their suggestion?

A. The Moon’s water content decreased after the
Moon was-formed.

B. The Moon’s water content increased rapidly after
the Moon was formed.

C. The Moon’s water content increased slowly after
the Moon was formed.

D. The Moon’s water content was constant after the
Moon was formed.

H. Observations 2 and 4
J. Observations 3 and 4

According to a simplified model of the hydrogen
atom, an electron orbits a proton located at the center of
the atom. The electron can exist only in certain orbits, each
with a specific radius. When the electron jumps from one
orbit to another orbit of smaller radius, the atom emits a
packet of energy known as a photon.

According to Figure 1, a hydrogen atom can emit any
one of the 3 types of photons when the electron jumps
from all of the following orbits EXCEPT:

F. Orbit 3.
G. Orbit 4.
H. Orbit 5.
J. Orbit 6.MATH
radius. Suppose the electron has jumped from Orbit 1
to Orbit 5 due to the absorption of the energy of a
single photon. Based on Figure 1, it is most likely that
the atom absorbed:

F. an ultraviolet photon.

T. a visible photon.

F. an infrared photon.

F. a photon that is neither ultraviolet, nor visible, nor
infrared.

READING
According to Table 1, the statement “As photon wave-
length decreases, photon energy increases” is true for

which types of photons?

F. Ultraviolet and visible only

F. Ultraviolet and infrared only

F. Visible and infrared only

T. Ultraviolet, visible, and infrared

According to Figure 1, if the electron in a hydrogen
atom jumps from Orbit 6 to Orbit 3, and then jumps

from Orbit 3 to Orbit 1, the atom will emit:

F. one infrared photon only.

F. one ultraviolet photon only.

F. one infrared photon, followed by one ultraviolet
photon.

T. one ultraviolet photon, followed by one infrared
photon.

MATH
Based on the information presented, which of the fol-
lowing statements about the relationship between the
electron’s orbit number and the energy of the hydrogen
atom is most likely true?

F. As the electron’s orbit number increases, the
energy of the hydrogen atom increases.

G. As the electron’s orbit number increases, the
energy of the hydrogen atom decreases.

H. As the electron’s orbit number increases, the
energy of the hydrogen atom increases and then
decreases.

J. As the electron’s orbit number increases, the
energy of the hydrogen atom remains the same.
