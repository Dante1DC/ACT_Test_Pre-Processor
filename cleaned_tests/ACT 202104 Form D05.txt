This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On
the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered
to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are
lettered to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the
oval in that row lettered the same as your answer.
Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil
and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink
or a mechanical pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark
thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each
question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals
with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only
on the number of questions you answer correctly during
the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized
for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing
staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is
called for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a test on which time has
already been called, and you may not go ahead to
another test. To do so will disqualify you from the
examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called
at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill
in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

Tania Willard, Beat Nation’s cofounder, traces

the 1990s. Standing amongst drummers from Canada’s
Secwepeme nation, an Indigenous break-dancing crew
six-stepped and moonwalked to the rhythms of traditional
hand drums. For Willard, the powwow represented the
culmination of a generational trend. Throughout the
1990s, many Indigenous young people left Canada’s
tural territories for Vancouver’s city streets. There,

in Vancouver, they discovered hip-hop and used it as

a means of self-expression. [B] In 2006, Willard began

highlighting their talents by promoting their work.

PASSAGE II
What’s Shaking, Tree Frog?

Red-eyed tree frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) lay
their eggs in clutches, gelatinous sacs of dozens of eggs,
on tree leaves that dangle over ponds and swamps. Mature
tadpoles hatch in six to eight days, gently dropping into
the water. Though the egg clutches are safer when stuck
to a leaf, than they would be drifting in a pond snakes

16
can find and eat them. Fortunately, the clutches have a

defense. As a snake attacks an A. callidryas egg clutch,
the tadpoles that haven’t been harmed hatch prematurely.
As early as four days into development, the tadpoles can

7
burst out of their eggs to swim away.

www.crackab.com

Biologist, Karen Warkentin, wanted to determine why
rs

the egg clutches react to being shaken and tugged during

a snake attack they rarely react to being jostled during a

oy
rainstorm. She inserted devices called accelerometers,

which measure and record the frequency of vibrations,

20
into egg clutches at Ocelot Pond, near Gamboa,
Panama. Her recordings revealed that a snake attack

and a rainstorm each cause sustained low-frequency

vibrations of the egg clutch. However, it also

showed that a rainstorm usually produces short

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is from the short story
“Long Distance” by Alejandro Zambra.

Portillo was a good boss, a generous guy; I rarely
saw him, sometimes only on the twenty-ninth, when I
waited, with some stupendous circles under my eyes, to
pick up my paycheck. What I remember most about him
is his voice, so high-pitched, like a teenager’s—a
common enough tone among Chileans but, for me, a
disconcerting one to hear from a Spaniard. He would
call me very early, at six or seven in the morning, so I
could give him a report on what had happened the pre-
vious night, which was pretty much pointless, because
nothing ever happened, or almost nothing: maybe some
call or other from Rome or Paris, simple cases from
people who weren’t really sick but who wanted to make
the most of the medical insurance they had bought in
Santiago. My job was to listen to them, take down their
information, make sure the policy was valid, and con-
nect them to my counterparts in Europe.

Portillo let me read or write, or even doze off, on
the condition that I always answer the phone in good
time. That’s why he called at six or seven—although,
when he was out partying, he might call earlier. “The
phone should never ring more than three times,” he
would tell me if I took too long picking up. But he
didn’t usually scold me; on the contrary, he was quite
friendly. Sometimes he asked me what I was reading. I
would say Paul Celan, or Emily Dickinson, or
Emmanuel Bove, or Humberto Diaz Casanueva, and he
always burst out laughing, as if he had just heard a very
good and very unexpected joke.

One night, around four in the morning, I received a
call from someone whose voice sounded mock-serious,
or disguised, and I thought it was my boss pretending to
be someone else. “I’m calling from Paris,” said the
voice. The man was calling direct, which increased my
feeling that it was a prank of Portillo’s, because clients
usually reversed the charges when they called. Portillo
and I had a certain level of trust between us, so I told
him not to mess with me, that I was very busy reading.
“I don’t understand, I’m calling from Paris,” the man
responded. “Is this the number of the travel insurance?”

I apologized and asked him for his number so I
could call him back. When we talked again I’d become
the nicest phone operator on the planet, which wasn’t

really necessary, because I’ve never been impolite, and
because the man with the unrealistic voice was also
unrealistically nice, which was not usual in that job: it
was more common for clients to show their bad man-
ners, their high-handedness, their habit of treating
phone operators badly, and surely also laborers, cooks,
salespeople, or any other of the many groups made up
of their supposed inferiors.

Juan Emilio’s voice, on the other hand, suggested
the possibility of a reasonable conversation, although I
don’t know if reasonable is the word, because as I was
taking down his information (fifty-five years old, home
address in Lo Curro, no preexisting conditions) and
checking his policy (his insurance had the best cover-
age available on the market), something in his voice
made me think that, more than a doctor, he just needed
someone to talk to, someone who would listen.

He told me he’d been in Europe for five months,
most of that time in Paris, where his daughter-—whom
he called la Mofio—was working on her doctorate and
living with her husband—el Mati—and the kids. None
of this was in response to my questions, but he was
talking so enthusiastically that it was impossible for me
to break in. He told me how the kids spoke French with
charmingly correct accents, and he also threw in a few
commonplace observations about Paris. By the time he
started talking to me about the difficulties la Mofio had
been having lately meeting her academic obligations,
about the complexity of the doctoral programs, and
about what kind of sense parenthood made in a world
like this one (“a world that sometimes seems so strange
nowadays, so different,” he told me), I realized we’d
been talking for almost forty minutes. I had to interrupt
him and respectfully ask him to tell me why he was
calling. He told me he was a little under the weather,
and he’d had a fever. I typed up the fax and sent it to the
office in Paris so they could coordinate the case, and
then I started the long process of saying good-bye to
Juan Emilio, who fell all over himself in apologies and
politeness before finally accepting that the conversation
had ended.

Back then I’d picked up a few evening hours
teaching at the technical training institute. The schedule
fit perfectly.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is from the book On the
Map: A Mind-Expanding Exploration of the Way the World
Looks by Simon Garfield.

We are now sure—because we have seen it on
maps—that California is firmly attached to Oregon,
Arizona and Nevada. Even south of San Diego, when it
eventually becomes the Mexican state of Baja Califor-
nia, it is firmly hitched to the mainland. But in 1622,
something untoward happened. After eighty-one years
officially attached to a huge landmass, California
drifted free. It wasn’t a radical act of political will, nor
a single mistake (a slip of an engraver, perhaps), but a
sustained act of cartographic misjudgment. Stranger
still, the error continued to appear on maps long after
navigators had tried to sail entirely around it and—with
what must have been a sense of utter bafflement—
failed.

The name California first appeared on a map in
1541. It was drawn as part of Mexico by Domingo del
Castillo—a pilot on an expedition by Hernando de
Alarc6n—and it is shown as a peninsula and labeled. Its
first appearance on a printed map occurred in 1562,
when the Spanish pilot and instrument maker Diego
Gutierrez again wrote its name at the tip of a peninsula,
a very minor detail on a busy and very beautiful engrav-
ing of the New World. The map, the largest then made
of the region at 107 x 104 cm, may have been engraved
after Gutierrez’s death by Hieronymus Cock, an artist
who clearly took great delight in imaginative trappings:
huge ships and legends populate its seas, with Poseidon
driving horses on a seaworthy chariot, and a huge
gorilla-type creature breaking the waves while it dines
on a fish.

California subsequently appeared attached to the
mainland for sixty years. And then off it floated into the
Pacific, where it remained a cartographic island for
more than two centuries.

Its first known insular appearance occurred in
1622, on an inset on a title page of a Spanish volume
entitled Historia General. Two years later it was drift-
ing free, bounded by the Mar Vermeio and Mar Del Zur
on a Dutch map by Abraham Goos. But it received its
most prominent currency on a London map of 1625
entitled “The North Part of America.” This accompa-
nied an article about the search for the Northwest
Passage by the mathematician Henry Briggs. He sup-
plemented the great untracked northerly spaces toward
the Arctic with text describing the wonders of his map,
“Conteyning Newfoundland, new Eng/land, Virginia,
Florida, New Spaine . . . and upon ye West the large
and goodly Iand/ of California.” On the eastern
seaboard both Plymouth and Cape Cod are placed in
Massachusetts, but not yet Boston.

The misconception persisted for decades. It was
the seventeenth century’s forerunner to a mistake on
Wikipedia—doomed to be repeated in a thousand
school essays until a bright spark noticed it and dared

to make amends. Compiling a paper for the California
Map Society in 1995, Glen McLaughlin and Nancy H.
Mayo catalogued 249 separate maps (not including
world maps) which cast the Golden State adrift. Their
names carry bold assertions, with no wiggle room: “A
New and Most Exact map of America” claimed one,
while another promised “America drawn from the latest
and best Observations.” Between 1650 and 1657, the
French historian Nicolas Sanson published several
maps that showed California as an island, and their
translations into Dutch and German ensured that they
superseded Briggs as the most influential mythmakers
for half a century. But they also promoted newer, truer
discoveries, including the first cartographic depiction
of all five Great Lakes.

Even when new maps were published showing
California attached to the mainland, the island kept on
appearing. In the end, though, it was killed off by a
royal decree issued by Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1747,
which denied the possibility of this Northwest Passage
with the reasonably clear statement: “California is
not an Island.” Yet news traveled slowly. California
appeared as an island on a map made in Japan as late as
1865.

And how did it all begin? The cartographical point
zero has been tracked to a Carmelite friar named
Antonio de la Acensién who sailed with Sebastian
Vizcaino along the West Coast in 1602-3 and kept a
journal. Two decades later he is believed to have
mapped his trip on paper, which featured California as
an island nation. The map was sent to Spain, but the
ship on which it traveled was captured by the Dutch,
and it ended its journey in Amsterdam. In 1622, Henry
Briggs wrote of seeing this map of California in
London. And shortly afterward, the map drawn from
the one “taken by Hollanders” was set in copper and
began its journey through the world.

HUMANITIES: This passage is from the book Apollo's Angels:
A History of Ballet by Jennifer Homans.

I never thought of ballet as anything but contem-
porary, a here-and-now art. Even the oldest of ballets
are of necessity performed by young people and take on
the look of their generation. Besides, unlike theater or
music, ballet has no texts and no standardized notation,
no scripts or scores, and only the most scattered written
records; it is unconstrained by tradition and the past.
Choreographer George Balanchine encouraged this
idea. In countless interviews he explained that ballets
are here and gone, like flowers or butterflies, and that
dance is an ephemeral art of the present; carpe diem.
The point, he seemed to be saying, was not to bring
back old musty dances such as Swan Lake: it was to
“make it new.” For the dancers, however, this was a
paradoxical injunction: history was all around us—in
our teachers and the dances, but also in Balanchine’s
own ballets, many of which were suffused with memo-
ries and a Romantic ethos. But we nonetheless made a
cult of never looking back, of setting our sights res-
olutely on the present.

And yet it is because ballet has no fixed texts,
because it is an oral and physical tradition, a story-
telling art passed on, like Homer’s epics, from person to
person, that it is more and not less rooted in the past.
For it does have texts, even if these are not written
down: dancers are required to master steps and varia-
tions, rituals and practices. These may change or shift
over time, but the process of learning, performing, and
passing them on remains deeply conservative. When an
older dancer shows a step or a variation to a younger
dancer, the ethics of the profession mandate strict obe-
dience and respect: both parties rightly believe that a
form of superior knowledge is passing between them. I
never for a moment, for example, questioned the steps
or style Alexandra Danilova conveyed when she taught
us variations from The Sleeping Beauty: we clung to her
every movement. The teachings of the master are
revered for their beauty and logic, but also because they
are the only connection the younger dancer has to the
past—and she knows it. It is these relationships, the
bonds between master and student, that bridge the cen-
turies and give ballet its foothold in the past.

Ballet, then, is an art of memory, not history. No
wonder dancers obsessively memorize everything:
steps, gestures, combinations, variations, whole ballet:
It is difficult to overstate this. Memory is central to the
art, and dancers are trained, as the ballerina Natalia
Makarova once put it, to “eat” dances—to ingest them
and make them part of who they are. These are physical
memories; when dancers know a dance, they know it in
their muscles and bones. Recall is sensual and brings
back not just the steps but also the gestures and feel of
the movement, the “perfume,” as Danilova said, of the
dance—and the older dancer. Thus ballet repertory is
not recorded in books or libraries: it is held instead in
the bodies of dancers. Most ballet companies even

appoint special “memorizers”—dancers whose prodi-
gious recall sets them apart from their peers—to store
its works: they are ballet’s scribes (and pedants) and
they keep whole oeuvres in their limbs, synchronized
(usually) to music that triggers the muscles and helps to
bring back the dance. But even dancers with superlative
memories are mortal, and with each passing generation,
ballet loses a piece of its past.

As a result, the ballet repertory is notoriously thin.
The “classics” are few and the canon is small. We have
only a handful of past ballets, most of which originated
in nineteenth-century France or late Imperial Russia.
The rest are relatively new: twentieth- and twenty-first-
century works. There is some record of seventeenth-
century court dances, but the notation system recording
these dances died out in the eighteenth century and has
never been fully replaced. These court dances are thus
an isolated snapshot; the before and after are missing.
The rest is spotty and full of holes. One might suppose
that French ballet would be well preserved: the funda-
mental precepts of classical ballet were codified in
seventeenth-century France and the art form has
enjoyed an unbroken tradition there to the present day.
But we have almost nothing. La Sylphide premiered in
Paris in 1832, but that version was soon forgotten: the
version we know today originated in Denmark in 1836.
Coppélia, from 1870, is in fact the only nineteenth-
century French ballet still widely performed in its
(more or less) original form.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: Passage A is from the article “Just Add
Water” by Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams. Passage B is
from the article “Plate Tectonics Spotted on Europa” by
Thomas Sumner.

Passage A by Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams

A look at our neighbours Mars and Venus shows
how lucky Earth has been. They too had surface water
in the early days, perhaps even large oceans. On frozen
Mars today we see ancient shorelines more than 3 bil-
lion years old, and detect clays formed in water. Soon,
though, Mars lost most of its atmosphere and protective
magnetic field, and its water vapour leaked away. Venus
is an inferno surrounded by suffocating clouds of sul-
phuric acid now, but probe measurements show it too
once had abundant liquid water, until rising levels of
water vapour and carbon dioxide led to a runaway
greenhouse effect that boiled it off.

What made Earth different? The key is probably
plate tectonics. The movement of segments of Earth’s
uppermost layer is unique, we think, among the rocky
planets of the solar system. They crash against each
other, buckling, rising or driving down into the planet’s
hot mantle. There is some evidence such tectonics tried
to start up on Mars, but if so it didn’t last long. On
Earth, it has created natural depressions: ocean basins,
underlain by dense newly forming crust, that hold
deeper waters; and shallow seas on the lighter, more
ancient crust of the continents. The bottom of these
containers is cracked at the subduction zones where
water-soaked plates slide down into the mantle. That
water is mostly wrung back out to emerge as volcanic
steam in mountain ranges.

This constant cycling of water, and the unlikely
coexistence of wet and dry surfaces is, it turns out, cru-
cial. Water evaporating from the oceans condenses as
rain and chemically attacks the land, modulating atmo-
spheric composition and global temperature. The
atmosphere thus formed has a lid—a “cold trap” made
by the chill of the stratosphere—that freezes water
vapour out and stops it escaping into space. Below this
lid, almost uncannily, all three phases of water—solid,
liquid and gas—coexist almost all of the time: the only
planetary surface known where this has been sustained
for any long period.

To complete this remarkable planetary machine,
plate tectonics itself needs water to function: water
lubricates descending tectonic plates and softens mantle
minerals so they melt more easily. Geochemist Francis
Albaréde of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Lyon,
France, thinks that water’s arrival from outer space
kick-started the plate-tectonic motor 3 billion years
ago.

Passage B by Thomas Sumner

Plate tectonics churns the icy exterior of Jupiter’s
moon Europa, researchers reported in 2014. The finding
marks the first evidence of plate tectonics beyond
Earth.

“Earth is not unique—we’ve found another body in
the solar system with plate tectonics,” says planetary
scientist Simon Kattenhorn of the University of Idaho
in Moscow. “This tells us that this process can happen
on more than just rocky planets like Earth.”

Previous observations have seen surface reshaping,
such as volcanic activity, on other planetary bodies
including Saturn’s moon Titan. However, Kattenhorn
says, Europa is the first found with a patchwork of
drifting tectonic plates.

The rising and sinking ice slabs on Europa’s sur-
face may provide a mechanism for nutrients to move
from the moon’s surface to its subsurface ocean,
Kattenhorn argues. Such transport would bolster the
likelihood that this ocean hosts life. Astrobiologist
Britney Schmidt of Georgia Tech in Atlanta says the
mechanism is “very exciting for Europa’s chances for
supporting life.”

Though the moon formed over 4 billion years ago,
at the same time as the rest of the solar system,
Europa’s icy surface is surprisingly young. Based on
the moon’s small number of impact craters, scientists
estimate Europa’s surface to be just 40 million to
90 million years old. Dark bands crisscross the moon
where warm, fresh ice wells up to the frigid surface, but
a mystery remained: Where is the old material?

Two years ago, Kattenhorn and coauthor Louise
Prockter of Johns Hopkins University spotted some-
thing odd as they scoured a Louisiana-sized portion of
Europa mapped by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft in 1998.
In the moon’s northern hemisphere, a 20,000-square-
kilometer hunk of landscape was missing. Like a torn
photograph placed so that the pieces overlap, Europa’s
crisscrossing surface fractures didn’t properly line up.

The researchers propose that this discrepancy
marks where two massive ice slabs smashed together,
with one sinking under the other and blending into the
moon’s warmer interior ice. The action resembles a
subduction zone on Earth, where one slab of crust—or
tectonic plate—slides beneath another.

Passage |

Solar time is determined by the position of the Sun
relative to a meridian (an imaginary line that passes
through the northernmost and southernmost points of the
horizon, dividing the visible sky into 2 equal halves). At
solar noon, the Sun appears to cross the meridian. A solar
day is the period between one solar noon and the next.
Because the Sun’s apparent motion is not uniform, a solar
day is generally not the same length as a mean day, which
is exactly 24 hrs (1,440 min). See Figure 1.

A 1.5L pot was prepared by placing 500g of
Mixture | into the pot, after which the pot was stored at
30°C for 72 hr. The pot and its contents were then baked in
a 105°C oven for 24 hr. After cooling, the mixture’s bulk
density (the dry mass of the mixture per unit volume) was
determined.

These procedures were repeated for each of Mix-
tures 2—5 (see Table 2).

and baked as in Study 1. The dried mixture was then
ground and screened as in Study 2.

Fifty grams of the screened powder were mixed with
5 mL of H,0 to form a soil paste, and the paste was placed
on a filter. Suction was then applied to the filter, and
the extract (the clear, colorless liquid that passed through
the filter) was collected. The electrical conductivity of the
extract was determined.

Passage IV

When a sand-covered drumhead vibrates at certain
frequencies, the sand collects at nodes (areas of least vibra-
tion). Two types of nodes can form on a vibrating drum-
head: radial nodes, which look like rings, and linear nodes,
which look like straight lines. As sand collects at nodes,
patterns called nodal patterns (NPs) form. Figure | shows
two NPs that can form on a sand-covered drumhead: NP |
(a radial node only) and NP 2 (a radial node and a linear
node).

NP 1 NP2

Figure |

Students performed 2 experiments to study the forma-
tion of NP | and NP 2 on various drumheads.

Experiment 1

The students obtained 5 drumheads, each having a dif-
ferent diameter and each set to a tension of 2,000 newtons
per meter (N/m). They performed a trial with each drum-
head, using the following procedure: First, they placed the
drumhead directly above a speaker emitting sound waves
having a frequency of 90 hertz (Hz). Then, they gradually
increased the frequency until they observed NP 1. Finally,
they continued to increase the frequency until they
observed NP 2. Throughout each trial, the amplitude (loud-
ness) of the sound waves was held constant. Table 1 shows
the frequency at which the students observed NP | and
NP 2 for each trial.

The students performed 7 more trials with the 50 cm
diameter drumhead. In each trial, first the tension was
adjusted to a certain value, and then the procedures of the

stant, whereas in Experiment 2, loudness was held
constant and frequency was varied.

C. 5 drumheads were used, whereas in Experiment 2,
1 drumhead was used.

D. 5 drumheads were used, whereas in Experiment 2,
7 drumheads were used.

Based on the results of Experiment 1, for the 60 cm
diameter drumhead, what was the difference between

For a given diameter and tension, the fundamental fre-
quency is the frequency at which NP | is observed.
Suppose that, for a 20 cm diameter drumhead set at a
tension of 2,000 N/m, a certain NP is known to form at
a frequency that is 2.3 times the fundamental fre-
quency. Based on the results of Experiment 1, this NP
would most likely form at approximately what
frequency?

A. 330 Hz
B. 530 Hz
C. 759 Hz

A student claimed that the greater the drumhead diam-
eter, the longer the wavelength of sound needed to
observe a given NP. Is this claim supported by the
results for NP 2 from Experiment | ?

F. Yes; as the diameter was increased, the frequency
at which NP 2 was observed increased.

G. Yes; as the diameter was increased, the frequency
at which NP 2 was observed decreased.

H. No; as the diameter was increased, the frequency
at which NP 2 was observed increased.

J. No; as the diameter was increased, the frequency
at which NP 2 was observed decreased.

Passage V

Three students observed that Trait R is present in
some people but not in others. The presence or absence of
Trait R in a person is determined entirely by alleles of
Gene R. Gene R has 2 alleles: R, which is dominant, and r,
which is recessive.

A teacher gave the students a pedigree showing the
inheritance of Trait R in a particular family (see Figure 1).
Each individual represented in the pedigree was assigned a
number (shown below the symbol for the individual) for
reference. Based on the pedigree, each student proposed a
hypothesis explaining the pattern of inheritance for Trait R
in this family.

Passage VI

The hot, spicy flavor of chili peppers is directly pro-
portional to the concentration of capsaicinoids (a class of
chemical compounds). Scientists studied the effects of fer-
tilizer application and pepper color on the capsaicinoid
concentration of 3 varieties of chili peppers (V1—V3).

Study

Two hundred V1 plants that were 82 days old were
divided into 4 equal groups, and each group was planted in
a different plot (Plot L, M, N, or O) in a particular field.
This procedure was repeated with V2 and V3 plants in sep-
arate, but adjacent, fields. Fertilizer was then applied to the
type L plots and the type M plots. Each plot was irrigated
equally once every 20 days until harvest. All the peppers in
the type L plots and the type N plots were harvested
77 days after planting, while the peppers were still green.
All the peppers in the type M plots and the type O plots
were harvested 87 days after planting, after the peppers had
turned red. Table | summarizes, for each plot type, whether
fertilizer was applied to the plot and the color of the pep-
pers in the plot at the time of harvest.

Table |

Immediately after being harvested, all the peppers
were dried at 65°C for 24 hr. Then, for each field, all the
dried peppers grown in a given plot were ground up and
combined. The total capsaicinoid concentration, in mil-
ligrams of capsaicinoids per gram of dry pepper (mg/g),
was then determined for the peppers from each plot of each
field. The results are shown in Table 2.

the lowest total capsaicinoid content.

H. The V3 peppers grown in Plot O, because they had
the highest total capsaicinoid content.

J. The V3 peppers grown in Plot O, because they had
the lowest total capsaicinoid content.

The spiciness of a pepper is often reported in Scoville
heat units (SHU). In general, the higher the total cap-
saicinoid concentration, the higher the SHU value.
Based on the results of the study for V1 in the plots
that had fertilizer applied, would the SHU rating likely
have been higher for green peppers or for red peppers?

A. Green; the total capsaicinoid concentration of the
Plot L peppers was higher than that of the Plot M
peppers.

B. Green; the total capsaicinoid concentration of the
Plot N peppers was higher than that of the Plot O
peppers.

C. Red; the total capsaicinoid concentration of the
Plot L peppers was higher than that of the Plot M
peppers.

D. Red; the total capsaicinoid concentration of the
Plot N peppers was higher than that of the Plot O
peppers.

Consider the statement “For a given variety of pepper
grown without applied fertilizer, the total capsaicinoid
concentration of red peppers is generally higher than
that of green peppers.” Are the results of the study for
V3 consistent with this statement?

F. No, because the total capsaicinoid concentration of
the Plot L peppers was higher than that of the
Plot M peppers.

G. No, because the total capsaicinoid concentration of
the Plot N peppers was higher than that of the
Plot O peppers.

H. Yes, because the total capsaicinoid concentration
of the Plot L peppers was higher than that of the
Plot M peppers.

J. Yes, because the total capsaicinoid concentration
of the Plot N peppers was higher than that of the
Plot O peppers.

Assume that 50 kg of fertilizer was applied to each
plot that was fertilized in the study. Suppose an addi-
tional plot type in which 100 kg of fertilizer was
applied to each plot had also been included in the
study. The peppers grown in these plots were harvested
77 days after planting in the fields. The results are
shown in the following table.

Total capsaicinoid
Pepper concentration

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
