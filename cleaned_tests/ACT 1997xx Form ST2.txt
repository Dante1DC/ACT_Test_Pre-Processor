ACT Assessment®

Directions

This booklet contains tests in English, Mathemat-
ics, Reading, and Science. These tests measure
skills and abilities highly related to high school
course work and_ success in_ college.
CALCULATORS MAY BE USED ON THE
MATHEMATICS TEST ONLY.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered.
On the answer document, the rows of ovals are
numbered to match the questions, and the ovals in
each row are lettered to correspond to the sug-
gested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is
best. Next, locate on the answer document the row
of ovals numbered the same as the question. Then,
locate the oval in that row lettered the same as your
answer. Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a
soft lead pencil and make your marks heavy and
black. DO NOT USE A BALLPOINT PEN.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you
change your mind about an answer, erase your first
mark thoroughly before marking your new answer.
For each question, make certain that you mark in
the row of ovals with the same number as the ques-
tion.

Only responses marked on your answer docu-
ment will be scored. Your score on each test will be
based only on the number of questions you answer
correctly during the time allowed for that test. You
will NOT be penalized for guessing. IT IS TO
YOUR ADVANTAGE TO ANSWER EVERY
QUESTION EVEN IF YOU MUST GUESS.

You may work on each test ONLY when your test
supervisor tells you to do so. If you finish a test
before time is called for that test, you should use
the time remaining to reconsider questions you are
uncertain about in that test. You may NOT look
back to a test on which time has already been
called, and you may NOT go ahead to another test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is
called at the end of each test. You may NOT for
any reason fill in or alter ovals for a test after time is
called for that test. To do so will disqualify you from
the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In the
right-hand column, you will find alternatives for each
underlined part. You are to choose the one that best
expresses the idea, makes the statement appropriate for
standard written English, or is worded most consistently
with the style and tone of the passage as a whole. If you
think the original version is best, choose “NO CHANGE.”

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions

do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. You
cannot determine most answers without reading several
sentences beyond the question. Be sure that you have
read far enough ahead each time you choose an
alternative.

upraised knees. You are waiting.

Then they come out of the sea, and are three
massive turtles. They are giant leatherback turtles, seven

feet long and weighing 1,000 to 1,500 pounds. They can

Question 15 asks about the essay as a whole.

15.

Suppose the writer had been assigned to write an essay
explaining the reproductive methods of different
species of turtles. Would this essay successfully fulfill
the assignment?

A. Yes, because the essay focuses on the turtles and
their egg-laying process.

B. Yes, because the essay describes the reproductive
methods of giant leatherback turtles.

C. No, because the essay restricts its focus to the
writer’s experience of witnessing the egg-laying
process of giant leatherback turtles.

D. No, because the essay omits mention of any turtle
behavior connected with their means of reproduc-
tion.

PASSAGE I
Prepared for Anything
My mother is a justice of the peace; that means
she has the power to perform weddings. She has to be
prepared for anything, because weddings these days can
range from formal evening gown affairs to barefoot frolics
during which the bride’s dog might play the part of the

ring bearer. She loves them all.

Sadly, the converse is equally true: a culture that
blinds itself to flaws and dwells on the positive can
create serious trouble for itself. Many historians
believe that the self-indulgence and nationalism of
the 1920s, for example, led directly to the Great

Depression, which entertained breadlines and dust bowls.

As the philosopher George Santayana said “Those
who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.” In their effort to dwell on only the upbeat aspects of

history, the people peddling like in nostalgia are distorting
i

the past, and remembering it. The more distorted our past
becomes, the more doomed we are to repeat it. Or, to put
it another way, the more we look at the silver lining and
ignore the clouds, the more likely we are to be caught in

the rain with no umbrella.

Because each major Japanese corporation recruits

university is important for students. Therefore, most

parents encourage their children to attend jukus, or private

extra work helps the students to score well on entrance
exams, which determine what universities they may
attend. Once accepted into college, students are almost

such terrible things about it? We’ve been told it threat-
ens to fragment American culture into a warren of eth-
nic enclaves, each separate and inviolate. We’ve been
told that it menaces the Western tradition of literature
and the arts. We've been told it aims to politicize the
school curriculum, replacing honest historical scholar-
ship with a “feel good” syllabus designed solely to bol-
ster the self-esteem of minorities. The alarm has been
sounded, and many scholars and educators—liberals as
well as conservatives—have responded to it. After ali,
if multiculturalism is just a pretty name for ethnic
chauvinism, who needs it?

There is, of course, a liberal rejoinder to these
concerns, which says that this isn’t what multicultural-
ism is—-or at least not what it ought to be. The liberal
pluralist insists that the debate has been miscast from
the beginning and that it is worth setting the main
issues straight.

There’s no denying that the multicultural initiative
arose, in part, because of the fragmentation of
American society by ethnicity, class, and gender. To
make it the culprit for this fragmentation is to mistake
effect for cause. Mayor Dinkins’s metaphor about New
York as a “gorgeous mosaic” is catchy but unhelpful, if
it means that each culture is fixed in place and sepa-
rated by grout. Perhaps we should try to think of
American culture as a conversation among different
voices—even if it’s a conversation that some of us
weren’t able to join until recently. Perhaps we should
think about education, as the conservative philosopher
Michael Oakeshott proposed, as “an invitation into the
art of this conversation in which we learn to recognize
the voices,” each conditioned, as he says, by a different
perception of the world. Common sense says that you
don’t bracket 90 percent of the world’s cultural her-
itage if you really want to learn about the world.

To insist that we “master our own culture” before
learning others only defers the vexed question: What
gets to count as “our” culture? What makes knowledge
worth knowing? Unfortunately, as history has taught
us, an Anglo-American regional culture has too. often
masked itself as universal, passing itself off as our
“common culture,” and depicting different cultural tra-
ditions as “tribal” or “parochial.” So it’s only when
we're free to explore the complexities of our hyphen-
ated American culture that we can discover what a gen-
uinely common American culture might actually look
like. Common sense reminds us that we're all
ethnics, and the challenge of transcending ethnic chau-
vinism is one we all face.

Granted, multiculturalism is no magic panacea for
our social ills. We're worried when Johnay can’t read.

We're worried when Johnny can’t add. But shouldn’t
55 we be worried, too, when Johnny tramples gravestones
in a Jewish cemetery or scrawls racial epithets on a
dormitory wall? It’s a fact about this country that
we've entrusted our schools with the fashioning and
refashioning of a democratic polity; that’s why the
schooling of America has always been a matter of
political judgment. But in America, a nation that has
theorized itself as plural from its inception, our schools
have a very special task.

The society we have made simply won’t survive
without the values of tolerance. And cultural tolerance
comes to nothing without cultural understanding. In
short, the challenge facing America in the next century
will be the shaping, at long last, of a truly common
public culture, one responsive to the long-silenced cul-
70 tures of color. If we relinquish the ideal of America as

a plural nation, we’ve abandoned the very experiment
that America represents.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from Lindsay
Heinsen’s “The Southern Artist: Kreg Kallenberger’ (©1991 by
Southern Accents, Inc.)..

As the Ozarks reach west from Missouri and
Arkansas, they give their final gasps north of Tulsa and
then collapse onto the Great Plains. The gasps are the
Qsage Hills. It’s a hard, undomesticated landscape of
low, bald elevations, red clay, and scrub oak. The
Osage Hills have cast no spell over Tulsa’s real-estate
developers who, in boom times, have pushed the city
relentlessly southward onto the plains. “This is forgot-
ten country,” says a man who grew up in its shadow.
10 “Most Tulsa residents don’t know it’s here.” Yet the
Osage Hills have found at least one contemporary poet
in sculptor Kreg Kallenberger. A soft-spoken man of
forty, Kallenberger moved to Tulsa at the age of one
and has seldom left since. From the foothills, it’s a

15 short drive down Apache Street to his home and studio
on Reservoir Hill. There, he reworks the burnt hills and
blasted sky in the cool medium of glass.

a

Kallenberger’s Osage sculptures would look at
home on the shelves of a Rocky Mountain minerals
shop, surrounded by geodes. Most are long wedges of
cast optical crystal, glacial melon slices weighing as
much as fifty pounds. On the tops and sides, they are
all precision—sliced, notched, and polished. Yet this
refinement has a raw edge. The rugged bottoms are
peaks and valleys, stained with the colors and vistas of
the nearby hills. As Kallenberger readies them for a
February show at Boca Raton’s Habatat Galleries,
Osage works are strewn about the studio. They seem to
have been sliced from the foothills with sky intact, as if
God were gathering landscape samples for the next
world.

These are works of time-consuming craftsman-
ship: when Kallenberger says, “I rarely leave the
house,” one believes him. His intensity and background
in engineering may be prerequisites for sculptors work-
ing with glass. The days are spent lugging crystal
ingots, tinkering with the furnace, sketching, fabricat-
ing molds, monitoring the slow processes of heating,
cooling, grinding, and polishing. His chosen wedge
shape is particularly vulnerable to the cooling process,
which lasts up to three weeks; if the power fails or the
equipment settings are inaccurate, the result is fracture.
“This is not a predictable industry,” he says. “You base
this success on the last failure.” He completed just
45 twelve Osage pieces last year.

The sculptor’s reputation has taken off in the past
six or seven years. He now has regular one-man shows
at the two Habatat Galleries, located at Farmington
Hills near Detroit and in Boca Raton. Through Habatat,

50 he has attended the influential New Art Forms show at
Chicago’s Navy Pier each autumn. And in 1984, on the
strength of his Interlock and Cuneiform series, he
received a National Endowment for the Arts
Fellowship Grant. He is represented in Tulsa by M. A.

Doran Gallery, and his works are in the Detroit
Institute of Arts, Atlanta’s High Museum of Art, and
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In April of [1990], Kallenberger was featured in
the Detroit Habatat’s Eighteenth Annual International
Invitational exhibition. Ferdinand Hampson, who
cofounded the gallery with Tom and Linda Boone,
says, “These are theoretically the greatest artists in
glass today, and Kreg dominated the show in sales and
critical opinion.”

Kallenberger’s current themes emerged with the
Titanic series in the mid-eighties. The wedges of his
earlier Cuneiform series reappeared, elongated and
deeper. Key details—a scoop or notch, a pair of black
circles—appeared on the thin top edge, in contrast with
the deep and massive whole. Along came the rough
edges, controlled fractures, eventually stained by hand.

The optical effects of the Osage sculptures are
dazzling. As one walks around each piece, its transpar-
ent volume suddenly fills up with the refracted land-
scape of the bottom edge—a sculpture filled with an
image. “The glass just does that,” he says. The power
of basic shapes is his focus, as are contrasts of texture
and color.

Oddly, the charisma of glass exerts a special fasci-
nation for men. “It seems to be made through mysteri-
ous processes,” Kallenberger says. Among his audience
are “CEOs [Chief Executive Officers of corporations]
who've never bought sculpture or any art before.”
Presented with identical shapes in bronze and glass,
this hypothetical male CEO will prefer the latter. Why?
“Because he thinks he knows how the bronze shape is
made. It’s made sort of like his car is made. It’s
metal—you can hammer on it, weld it. He looks at the
same form in glass and has no idea how it was made.
Men look at a piece and say, ‘How did you do that?’”

The passage indicates Kallenberger’s sculptures are
most vulnerable to damage during which part of their
production?

A. Mold fabrication

B. Heating process

C. Cooling period

D. Grinding procedure

Kallenberger says that by his observation male CEOs
frequently like what kind of art pieces best?

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Butterflies and Bad Taste: Rethinking a Classic Tale of
Mimicry” by Tim Walker (©1991 by Science Service, Inc.).

Picture a bird searching for a midafternoon
snack—perhaps a butterfly.

Suddenly, the bird spies a bright orange butterfly.
But instead of attacking, the bird ignores it. Why?
Because the bird remembers what happened the last
time it ate a bright orange butterfly: It vomited.

So the butterfly survives and continues on its way,
courtesy of the bright orange warning that nature
painted on its wings.

But was this a faise warning? Did the butterfly’s
color trick the bird into passing up what would have
actually made a tasty hors d’oeuvre? If the orange
butterfly was a viceroy, Limenitis archippus, most
biologists would have answered yes. For more than a
century, the conventional wisdom has held that this
winged insect cloaks a very appetizing body behind the
colors of 2 toxic monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus.

New research indicates, however, that the viceroy
has successfully deceived scientists, not birds.
Entomologists have long labored under the assumption
that the viceroy’s orange warning colors were just a
bluff. Now, two zoologists have demonstrated that to
discerning birds, the viceroy can taste just as foul as
the noxious monarch.

Nineteenth-century English naturalist Henry
Walter Bates first put forth the idea that a species of
tasty butterfly could protect itself by evolving to mimic
a toxic species. One species’ exploitation of another’s
protection system has been called Batesian mimicry
ever since.

And for most of this century, biology textbooks
have touted the viceroy-monarch relationship as the
classic example of Batesian mimicry—a truism that
must now be reconsidered.

David B. Ritland and Lincoln P. Brower have con-
ducted an avian taste test. The test aimed to determine
which butterfly species, if any, were noxious to the
birds. Because these snacks lacked wings, the birds had
to base their selections on the taste of the butterflies’
bodies alone.

The birds found the viceroy just as unappetizing
as the monarch.

Why had no one challenged the viceroy’s avian
palatability before?

One reason, says entomologist Austin P. Platt, is
that the viceroy evolved from a group of tasty admiral
butterflies. “So it was just widely held that the viceroy
itself was also palatable,” he explains.

During the last several years, however, a few
50 experiments began to cast doubt on the viceroy’s
supposed tastiness. But those experiments used whole
butterflies, Ritland says, which meant that the taste-
testing birds could have rejected the viceroys because
of their orange wings and not because of any noxious

55 taste.

Moreover, many biologists believed butterflies
couldn’t manufacture their own toxic chemicals to
defend themselves from predators; instead, the insects
had to absorb the toxins of poisonous plants during
their caterpillar stage. And viceroy larvae don’t feed on
toxic plants.

6

3

The adult monarch’s chemical defense, however,
does depend on toxins in the milkweed plants on which
its caterpillars feed, Brower notes. Because monarch

65 caterpillars incorporate the heart toxins, called cardiac
glycosides, that milkweeds rely on for their own
defense against herbivores, eating a monarch can
“really set a bird’s heart jumping,” he observes.

But the toxicity of an individual monarch depends
on the variety of milkweed it ate as a caterpillar,
Brower says. A bird that eats a monarch butterfly that
dined as a caterpillar on a mildly toxic variety of milk-
weed will not be poisoned. But a monarch caterpillar
feeding on a strongly toxic milkweed variety will
become a truly toxic butterfly, potentially deadly to any
bird that eats one and doesn’t vomit it back up.

x

is

a

Viceroy caterpillars, in contrast, feed on nontoxic
willows, and this suggests that viceroy butterflies
somehow manufacture their own chemical defense. The

80 observation supports 4 new view that not all butterflies
depend on plant poisons for their defenses.

For example, Ritland and Brower’s results suggest
that the viceroy may actually be a “Mullerian” mimic
of the monarch. This kind of mutually advantageous

85 mimicry is named for the 19th-century German-born
Brazilian zoologist, Fritz Muller, who first described
how two or more equally distasteful butterfly species
gain greater protection from predators by evolving the
same general appearance.

90 Brower explains the advantage: If each of two
chemically protected species has a different wing-color
pattern, then a bird will have to eat many individuals of
each species before it learns to avoid both. But if both
species evolve the same color pattern, then only half as

95 many of each species need succumb.

31. The reason that Ritland and Brower’s work is forcing

reconsideration of a long-standing theory of the rela-
tionship between viceroy and monarch butterflies is
that their experiment demonstrated that the birds:

A. were not made ill by either viceroy or monarch

bodies.
B. would only eat butterflies whose wings were still

attached.

C. found viceroy bodies to be no tastier than those of
monarchs.

D. preferred the monarch bodies, contrary to the the-
ory.

. According to the passage, viceroy caterpillars feed on:

I. milkweed.
IL. nontoxic willows.
IL. mildly toxic willows.

Sram

According to David Ritland, recent experiments test-

ing the palatability of viceroy butterflies (lines 49-55)

were flawed primarily because the experimenters:

A. didn’t remove the butterflies’ wings.

B. doubted the tastiness of viceroys from the outset.

C. didn’t include monarch butterflies in the experi-
ments for comparison.

D. followed the widely held belief that viceroys taste
like admiral butterflies.

The passage suggests that the toxicity of the monarch
butterfly is primarily a result of the:

F. amount of milkweed that the monarch butterfly

eats.

G. ability of the monarch butterfly to manufacture its
own poison.

H. variety of milkweed that the monarch caterpillar
ate.

J. color of the monarch butterfly’s wings.

-37 -

35. Which of the following best describes the question that

remains unanswered from Ritland and Brower’s
research, as it is presented in the passage?

A. Why had no scientists discovered the toxicity of
viceroy butterflies before?

B. How do viceroy butterflies manufacture the toxic
chemicals in their system?

C. Why are some adult monarchs more poisonous
than others?
How are birds affected by the poison contained in
monarch butterflies?

It can be inferred from the passage that after a bird
eats a monarch butterfly, all of the following could
reasonably happen EXCEPT that the bird:

F. dies within a short period of time.

G. experiences a drastically increased heart rate.
H. immediately vomits the butterfly and dies.

J. vomits the butterfly and then survives.

According to the passage, the main difference between
Batesian and Mullerian mimicry is that:

A. Mullerian mimicry offers greater protection for
two inedible species through their resemblance,
while Batesian mimicry protects an edible species
because it looks like a poisonous one.

B. Batesian mimicry offers mutual protection for two
unappetizing species, while Mullerian mimicry
serves to protect an edible species simply because
it resembles a poisonous species.

C. Batesian mimicry involves a predator species
exploiting a prey species, while Mullerian mim-
icry involves cooperation between two species.

D. Batesian mimicry requires that the bad-tasting
species be actually tasted by the predator, while
Mullerian mimicry does not.

. If scientists conclude that Mullerian mimicry does pro-

vide an adequate explanation for the coloring of
viceroy butterflies, which of the following would the
mimicry be serving to protect?
I. Admiral butterflies
IL. Monarch butterflies
Ill. Viceroy butterflies

39. According to the passage, biologists were convinced

until recently that viceroy butterflies could NOT be
toxic because the biologists believed that:

A. butterflies could only become toxic if their larvae
ate toxic plants.

B. butterflies had to manufacture their owa poisons.

C. viceroy butterflies defended themselves by means
of mimicry.

D. viceroy caterpillars fed on only milkweed plants.

40. According to evidence presented in the passage, the

fact that Batesian mimicry was the readily accepted
explanation for the similarity of the viceroy’s appear-
ance to that of the monarch is likely due to the mis-
taken belief that:

F. the two species of butterflies were considered to
be closely related.

G. butterfly coloring was a function of the food that
the caterpillars eat.

H. Mullerian mimicry always involved one tasty and
one distasteful species.

J. viceroys must taste good because they were
evolved from another palatable species.

Passage Il

An acid-base titration involves slowly adding a mea-
sured amount of acid to a solution containing a base and an
indicator. The indicator, a dye, signals the endpoint (exact
point where the acid has consumed all of the base) by
changing colors as the solution goes from basic to acidic.
The pH scale is a relative measure of the strength of acids
and bases (see Figure 1). Table 1 shows the amount of acid
required to reach the endpoint of different basic solutions
containing various natural indicators.

Passage Ill

Many individuals past the age of 45 develop osteo-
porosis, which makes the bones less dense and is charac-
terized by a net loss of calcium in the bones. Although
osteoporosis occurs in men, it is more common in women.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
onset of osteoporosis.

Dietary Hypothesis

Calcium from food is absorbed into the bloodstream
by the small intestine. Vitamin D is necessary for this
process. Most Americans ingest too little calcium and vita-
min D in their diet. In a study of individuals 18-25 years
old, it was shown that the majority had significantly low
levels of calcium in their blood. When these individuals
received daily supplements of 1,500 mg of calcium and
400 units of vitamin D, their blood calcium levels
increased to normal levels. If insufficient levels.of calcium
and vitamin D are supplied by the diet, dietary supplements
should be taken to avoid osteoporosis.

Estrogen Hypothesis

Estrogens, hormones produced primarily in the
ovaries in women and, to a much lesser degree, in the
adrenal glands in both sexes, and androgens, produced in
the testes in men, are required for the deposition of calcium
into bone. Androgen levels in men remain relatively con-
stant throughout life; estrogen levels in women slowly
decline after the onset of menopause (the time when a
woman’s ability to reproduce ends), which usually occurs
between the ages of 45 and 55. As a result, the bones of
postmenopausal women lose calcium.

Scientists compared the bone density of 4 groups of
postmenopausal women. Each group took a dietary supple-
ment. The results are shown in the table.

Change in
Group Supplements bone density
A estrogen +2.3%
B 500 mg calcium -1.0%
c estrogen + 500 mg calcium 42.3%
D sugar 1.0%

Exercise Hypothesis

Lack of exercise results in calcium loss from bones,
whereas regular weight-bearing exercise can increase bone
density. One study showed that 8 weeks of weight training
added calcium and hardened bones in both postmenopausal
women and men over the age of 45. Since body weight is
supported by water, 8 weeks of swimming had no effect on
bone density. Both groups followed the same high-calcium
diet. Vitamin D intake was not measured.

11. To accept the evidence presented in the Dietary
Hypothesis, one must assume that low blood levels of
calcium are indicative of:

A. low bone levels of calcium.

B. low bone levels of estrogen.

C. high intestinal levels of vitamin D.
D. high blood levels of vitamin D.

12. One advantage of the Estrogen Hypothesis is that, of
the three hypotheses, it best explains why osteoporosis
is more common in which of the following groups?

F. Men over the age of 45 rather than in women over
the age of 45

G. Men over the age of 45 rather than in men under
the age of 45

H. Women over the age of 45 rather than in men over
the age of 45

J. Women under the age of 45 rather than in women
over the age of 45

13. According to the Estrogen Hypothesis, premenopausal
women who have had their ovaries surgically removed
should exhibit:

A. increased calcium levels in their bones.

B. increased estrogen levels in their blood.

C. gradual loss of calcium from their bones.

D. gradual reduction in vitamin D levels in their
blood.

15.

Which of the following is a criticism that supporters of
the Dietary Hypothesis would make of the experimen-
tal results cited in the Exercise Hypothesis?

F. Too much calcium was added to the diets of the
test subjects in both groups.

G. Blood vitamin D levels in the two groups were not
monitored.

H. Estrogen supplements should have been given to
each group of individuals.

J. Osteoporosis is more common in premenopausal
women than in postmenopausal women.

Assume that increased blood calcium levels result in

increased bone density. How would supporters of the

Estrogen Hypothesis explain the experimental results

presented in. the Dietary Hypothesis?

A. The test subjects probably had below-normal
blood calcium levels.

B. The test subjects did not perform any weight-bear-
ing exercise,

C. The test subjects probably had normal estrogen
and androgen levels.

D. The test subjects were given too low a dosage of
vitamin D.

17.

How would supporters of the Dietary Hypothesis
explain the results for Group B in the experiment cited
in the Estrogen Hypothesis?

F. Vitamin D supplements should not have been
taken by this group.

G. Insufficient calcium was added to the diet to
increase bone density.

H. Estrogen supplements should have been taken to
increase bone density.

J. Too much estrogen was added to the diet of this
group to affect bone density.

The experiments cited in the Estrogen Hypothesis and
in the Exercise Hypothesis are similar in that each:

A. test subject was given an estrogen supplement.
B. test subject was given a calcium supplement.
C. test subject was given a vitamin D supplement.
D. woman tested was postmenopausal.

Passage IV

Three studies were conducted to examine the relation-
ship between ants and the acacia trees they inhabit.

Study 1

Table 1 shows the results of a comparison between a
species of acacia tree that is inhabited by ants (ant trees)
and a species that is not inhabited by ants (non-ant trees).

Study 3

Acacia trees were divided into three groups. Acacia
ants were removed from the trees in Group A, but were left
on the trees in Group B. Group C consisted of a species of
non-ant acacia tree. All the trees were initially healthy and
of similar size. The number of trees still alive in each
group 300 days after the start of the study is shown in
Table 3.

Trees in Group A were killed by plant-eating insects
and large mammals that ate the leaves on lower branches.
There was no evidence that trees in Groups B and C were
killed by grazing animals.

18. How is the design of Study 1 different from the design
of Study 2?

F. In Study 1, acacia ants were removed from acacia
trees, but not in Study 2.

G. In Study 1, plant characteristics were examined,
while in Study 2, ant characteristics were exam-
ined.

H. In Study 1, acacia ants were examined, while in
Study 2, non-acacia ants were examined.

J. In Study 1, ant characteristics were examined,
while in Study 2, plant characteristics were exam-
ined,

19. On the basis of the experimental results, one can gen-
eralize that which of the following characteristics pro-
tects non-ant acacias from being eaten by insects or
grazing animals?

A. Bitter-tasting chemicals
B. Protein bodies

C. Extrafloral nectaries

D. Specialized hollow thorns

From the results of Study 2 the researchers would
hypothesize that the ground surrounding the ant acacia
trees was bare of vegetation because the:

F. acacia ants killed the plants growing near the ant
acacia trees.

G. acacia ants killed the plants growing near the non-
ant acacia trees.

H. non-acacia ants killed the plants growing near the
non-ant acacia trees,

plants and insects be drawn from the observations
made on acacias and ants?

A. Yes; the behavior of different insect species
toward plants seems to be the same.

B. Yes; some plants apparently provide shelter for the
insects that protect them.

C. No; plants apparently have the same species of
insects living on them.

D. No; insects are rarely associated with plants.

Researchers removed all the insects from a tree that is
different from the acacia. A comparison showed that
few leaves were eaten both before and after removal of
the insects. Which of the following conclusions about
the insects and the tree best explains these results?

F. The leaves were protected from grazing by some
factor other than the insects.

G. Numerous vines grew over the tree and covered
the leaves and stems.

H. The tree was unable to defend its leaves from
attacks by grazing animals.

J. Aggressive insects attacked any potential grazers
on the leaves of this tree.

Which of the following conclusions about the function
of protein bodies and extrafloral nectaries would be
consistent with the results of the studies?

A. Protein bodies are used to deter grazing animals,
while extrafloral nectaries are used as a food
source by acacia ants.

B. Extrafloral nectaries are used to deter grazing ani-
mals, while protein bodies are used as a food
source by acacia ants.

C. Both protein bodies and extrafloral nectaries are
used to deter grazing animals.

D. Both protein bodies and extrafloral nectaries are
used as food sources by acacia ants.

Passage V

A solution is a mixture of at least two substances. The
solvent does the dissolving and the solute is dissolved by
the solvent.

Some solutions containing solutes, called electrolytes,
can conduct electricity because they can carry an electric
charge when in solution; whereas nonelectrolytes cannot
carry an electric charge. An ammeter is a device used to
measure the current carried by a solution (see Figure 1).

G. 1.7 milliamps.
H. 7.4 milliamps.
J. 8.9 milliamps.

If Experiment 3 was repeated and the temperature of
the H,O was increased to 80°C, the conductivity of the
solutions with electrolytes would most likely:

A. decrease with the exception of HCl.
B. remain constant.

C. increase only.

D. increase with the exception of HCl.

Which of the following best explains why H,O was
tested in all three experiments?

F. To determine if H,O is the solute or the solvent

following effects would be most appropriate to test
next to gain additional information about conductivity?

Various chains were released from rest with their
lower end touching a scale that measured the force, in new-
tons (N), of the chain on the scale pan (see Figure 1). A
newton is the force required to accelerate a 1-kilogram
mass at a rate of 1.0 m/sec. The mass of the chain, its total
length (L), the momentary length of chain on the pan (x),
as well as the momentary weight of the portion of the chain

Passage VII

Early on May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens violently
erupted, expelling a huge cloud of volcanic ash. Most of
the ash fell to Earth on May 18, as the cloud moved rapidly
away from the volcano. The following studies examined
the ashfall.

Study I

Researchers measured the depth of uncompacted ash,
in millimeters (mm), at hundreds of stations in
Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Only ash that had fallen
on manufactured objects such as roofs and cars was mea-
sured. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Researchers found that ash deposits east of Yakima,
Washington, were composed of two different layers. The
thin lower layer (1-2 mm) was made of dark gray ash com-
posed of sand-sized particles of fragmented volcanic rock,
and, above that, a thicker layer of lighter-colored
ash was composed of smaller (silt-sized) particles (see
Figure 2).

It was believed that the dark ash formed during the 0 50 100 150 200 250
initial eruption, when rock from the mountain was pulver- .

ized, whereas the lighter-colored ash formed later in the distance (km)

eruption as molten rock (magma) inside the volcano was Ficure2

violently expelled. ‘igure

35. The researchers in Study 2 hypothesized that the dark

36.

37.

ash was ejected before the light gray ash. An alterna-
tive hypothesis is that both ash types were expelled
simultaneously, but that the darker particles were more
dense (“heavier”) and fell to the ground more rapidly.
Which of the following findings would disprove the
alternative hypothesis?

A. A light ash layer under a dark ash layer

B. A dark ash layer under a light ash layer

C. Light ash ejected higher into the air than dark ash

D. Light ash deposits found farther from the volcano
than dark ash deposits

Which of the following was varied in Study 3 ?

F. Size of the sample taken

G. Location of sites from which ash samples were taken

H. Method of determining the average ash particle
diameter

J. Mass of ash particles per cubic millimeter of ash

Do the results of Study 1 support the hypothesis that

volcanic ash rises into the atmosphere and settles out

evenly in a fairly circular region around the erupting

volcano?

A. No; the ash layer varied in thickness and was
deposited mainly east of the peak.

B. No; the ash layer was of a constant thickness
throughout the area of deposition and was
deposited along a relatively narrow path east of
the peak.

C. Yes; the ash layer varied in thickness and was

deposited in a circular pattern around the peak.
D. Yes; the ash layer was of constant thickness and
was deposited in a circular pattern around the peak.

no dark ash at any of the measurement sites.

'. no light ash at any of the measurement sites.

. a thinner ash layer in the center part of the line
than at the ends of it.
