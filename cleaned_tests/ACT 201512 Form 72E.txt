ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. in
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
‘one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

The team’s first experiment involving relocating the

ants after they'd found the food. [B] By moving the ants

to a new location, the scientists changed the direction the
ants would need to walk in order to return to their nest.
When the ants headed away from their nest, walking in the

direction in which they would have gone if they hadn’t
been moved, scientists concluded that ants rely on an
internal navigation system rather than external
markers.

[4] "|
They also tested what they referred to as “the
pedometer hypothesis.” [Cc] The scientists tied tiny

stilts made out of pig hair to some ants’ legs. With

the extended legs, which were made of pig hair, the ants

moved a greater distance with each step. Marching far

past their nest on the way home, the researchers
i0
determined that ants count their steps.

[5]

Plenty of questions remained. For instance, why
were the ants’ paths back to their nests more direct than
the ants’ routes to the food? The scientists suspected that
the ants, in addition to having an exoskeleton, were
constantly maintaining a sense of their location in relation

to their nest. [D] Because the routes home were so direct,

the ants must have been making adjustments all along.

Ten years earlier—before the sun first warmed it’s
chilly Dover home—Telkes had been studying how to
use the sun’s energy to produce clean drinking water
from salt water. Telkes had been working with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology before World

War II began, and her reputation as a chemical engineer

20
got the US government's attention. The US military hired

20
Telkes to design a water filtration system that could easily

be used by sailors, stranded at sea. Her solar still, which

removed the salt through vaporization instead of boiling,
produced countless gallons of drinkable water and saved
many lives. »

After the war, Telkes went back to work at MIT on
a much larger project, a home heating system powered
only by sunlight. [8] Then, in 1948, she began work

Complex musical numbers are a defining characteristic of

most Hindi films. This serves as interludes designed to
a

entertain the audience rather than to advance the plot. | +

Often featuring multiple settings or romanticized
backdrops, musical numbers in Hindi cinema emphasize
spectacle. One number in the 1951 film Awara was shot
on thirteen different sets. Two love songs in the 1981

film Silsila, set at large in India, was shot among tulips in
B

Holland. In regarding the Parsi tradition of using spectacle
to appeal to a broad audience, many Hindi films today
incorporate elements from Indian folk music, classical
music, and modern pop, often within a single song.

Hindi cinema is now one of the largest film industries

in the world, enduring criticism by some for its use of

ra

outdated technology. Modern Hindi filmmakers continue
a

to apply the conventions of Parsi theater by remaining

faithful to Indian traditions while appealing to a wide

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel
Homecoming: A Novel by Bernhard Schlink (©2006 by Bernhard
Schlink).

Once the supper table was cleared, the dishes
washed, and the flowers in the garden watered, my
grandparents would set to work on the Novels for Your
Reading Pleasure and Entertainment series. They
worked at the dining table, pulling the ceiling lamp
down and reading and editing the manuscripts, the page
proofs, and the bound galleys. Sometimes they did
some writing as well: they insisted that each volume
conclude with a brief didactic essay, and when none
10 was forthcoming they supplied it themselves. They

wrote about the importance of toothbrushing, the battle
against snoring, the principles of beekeeping, the his-
tory of the postal system. They also rewrote passages in
the novels when they found them awkward, unbeliev-
15 able, or immodest or when they felt they could make a
better point. The publisher gave them a free hand.

a

When I was old enough to stay up after the black-
bird had finished its song, I was allowed to sit with
them. The light of the lamp just above the table, the

20 dark of the room surrounding it—I loved it. I would
read or learn a poem or write a letter to my mother or
an entry in my summer diary. Whenever I interrupted
my grandparents to ask a question, I got a friendly
answer. I was afraid though to ask too many: I could

25 sense their concentration. The remarks they exchanged
were sparse, and my questions sounded garrulous. So I
read, wrote, and studied in silence. From time to time I
lifted my head cautiously, so as not to be noticed, and
observed them: Grandfather, his dark eyes now riveted

30 on the work before him, now gazing out, lost, into the
distance, and Grandmother, who did everything with a
light touch, reading with a smile and making correc-
tions with a quick and easy hand. Yet the work must
have been much harder on her than on him: while he

35 cared only for history books and had a neutral, objec-
tive relationship to the novels they dealt with, she loved
literature, fiction as well as verse, and had a sure feel-
ing for it; she must have suffered from having to spend
so much time on such banal texts.

40 I was not allowed to read them. If I grew curious
when they talked about one or another novel, I was told
in no uncertain terms I was not to read it: there was a

a

better novel or a better novella on the subject by
Conrad Ferdinand Meyer or Gottfried Keller or another
classic Swiss writer. Grandmother would then get up
and bring me the better book.

When they gave me the extra copies of the bound
galleys to take home as scrap paper, they made a point
of reminding me not to read them. They would not have
given them to me at all had paper not been so expensive
at the time and my mother’s income so low. Everything
I did not have to hand in to the teacher I wrote on the
back of the bound galleys: Latin, Greek, and English
vocabulary words, first drafts of compositions, plot
summaries, descriptions of famous paintings, world
capitals, rivers and mountains, important dates, and
notes to classmates a few desks away. I liked the thick
pads of thick paper, and because I was a good boy I
refrained from reading the printed sides of the pages for
years.

During the first few summers my grandparents
found the life I was leading with them too isolated, and
tried to bring me into contact with children my own
age. They knew their neighbors and by talking to a
number of families arranged for me to be invited to
birthday parties, outings, and visits to the local swim-
ming pool. Since it took a lot of doing and they did it
out of love, I did not dare resist, but I was always
happy when the event was over and I could return to
them. Friendships might have grown out of these con-
tacts had we seen one another more often, but the Swiss
children’s summer holidays began soon after I arrived,
and they would disperse, returning only shortly before
my departure.

So I spent my summer holidays without playmates
my own age; I spent them taking the same walks to the
lake and hikes through a ravine, around a pond, and up
a hill with a view of the lake and the Alps; I spent them
going on the same excursions to the Rapperswil
fortress, Ufenau Island, the cathedral, the museums.
These hikes and excursions were as much a part of the
summer as harvesting apples, berries, lettuce, and veg-
etables, hoeing beds, weeding, snipping wilted flowers,
trimming hedges, mowing grass, tending the compost,
keeping the watering can filled, and doing the watering.
Just as these operations recurred naturally, so the recur-
rence of the other activities struck me as natural. The
never-changing evenings at the table under the lamp
thus belonged to the natural rhythm of summer.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: Passage A is adapted from the article “The
Other Humans: Neanderthals Revealed” by Stephen S. Hall
(©2008 by The National Geographic Society). Passage B is
adapted from the editorial “Fossils for All” by the editors of the
journal Scientific American (©2009 by Scientific American,
Inc.).

Passage A by Stephen S. Hall

One of the longest and most heated controversies
in human evolution rages around the genetic relation-
ship between Neanderthals and their European succes-
sors. Did the modern humans sweeping out of Africa
beginning some 60,000 years ago completely replace
the Neanderthals, or did they interbreed with them? In
1997 the latter hypothesis was dealt a powerful blow by
geneticist Svante Péibo—then at the University of
Munich—who used an arm bone from the original
Neanderthal man to deliver it. Paubo and his colleagues
were able to extract a tiny 378-letter snippet of mito-
chondrial DNA (a kind of short genetic appendix to the
main text in each cell) from the 40,000-year-old speci-
men. When they read out the letters of the code, they
found that the specimen’s DNA differed from living
humans to a degree suggesting that the Neanderthal and
modern human lineages had begun to diverge long
before the modern human migration out of Africa. Thus
the two represent separate geographic and evolutionary
branches splitting from a common ancestor. If there
was any interbreeding when they encountered each
other later, it was too rare to leave a trace of Nean-
derthal mitochondrial DNA in the cells of living
people.

a

10

25 Paaibo’s genetic bombshell seemed to confirm that

Neanderthals were a separate species.

However, “During this time of the biological tran-
sition,” says Erik Trinkaus, a paleoanthropologist at
Washington University in St. Louis, “the basic behavior
{of the two groups] is pretty much the same, and any
differences are likely to have been subtle.” Trinkaus
believes they indeed may have mated occasionally. He
sees evidence of admixture between Neanderthals and
modern humans in certain fossils, such as a 24,500-
year-old skeleton of a child discovered at the Por-
iuguese site of Lagar Velho, and a 32,000-year-old skull
from a cave called Muierii in Romania.

Katerina Harvati, a researcher at the Max Planck
Institute in Leipzig, has used detailed 3-D measure-
ments of Neanderthal and early modern human fossils
to predict exactly what hybrids between the two would
have looked like. None of the fossils examined so far
matches her predictions.

40

The disagreement between Trinkaus and Harvati is
hardly the first time that two respected paleoanthropol-
ogists have looked at the same set of bones and come
up with mutually contradictory interpretations. Ponder-
ing—and debating—the meaning of fossil anatomy will
always play a role in understanding Neanderthals.

Passage B by the editors of Scientific American
50 In June of 2009 the famed Lucy fossil arrived in
New York City. The 3.2-million-year-old partial skele-
ton of Australopithecus afarensis could attract hundreds
of thousands of visitors over the course of her four-
month engagement—part of a six-year tour.
55 Before this tour, Lucy had never been on public
display outside of Ethiopia. One might expect scholars
of human evolution to be delighted by the opportunity
to share the discipline’s crown jewel with so many
members of the science-interested public. But news
reports announcing her New York debut included the
same objections that aired when she first landed in the
U.S.: namely, that the bones could sustain damage and
that the tour takes a key specimen out of scientific cir-
culation for too long. Indeed, some major museums
turned the exhibit away in part for those reasons.

60

65

The objections reflect a larger problem of posses-
siveness in the field of human origins. Indeed, fossil
hunters often block other scientists from studying their
treasures, fearing assessments that could scoop or dis-
agree with their own. In so doing, they are taking the
science out of paleoanthropology.

70

Critics of such secrecy commonly point to the case
of Ardipithecus ramidus, a 4.4-million-year-old human
ancestor discovered by Tim White of the University of
California, Berkeley. Fifteen years after White
announced the first fossils of A. ramidus and touted the
importance of this species for understanding human ori-
gins, access to the specimens remains highly restricted.

75

White, for his part, has said that he published only
an initial report and that normal practice is to limit
access until publication of a full assessment. And he
has noted that the condition of a key specimen—a badly
crushed skeleton—has slowed the release of the team’s
detailed report.

s

The scientists who unearth the remnants of human-
ity’s past deserve first crack at describing and analyz-
ing them. But there should be clear limits on this period
of exclusivity. Otherwise, the self-correcting aspect of
science is impeded: outside researchers can neither
reproduce the discovery team’s findings nor test new
hypotheses.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “New
Note: Esperanza Spalding’s Music” by John Colapinto (©2010
by Condé Nast).

In 2008, the prodigiously gifted bassist, singer,
and composer Esperanza Spalding released her major-
label début, Esperanza, which she recorded as a
twenty-three-year-old instructor at the Berklee College
of Music, in Boston. While the music was indisputably
jazz, it suggested an almost bewildering array of influ-
ences—fusion, funk, soul, rhythm and blues, Brazilian
samba and Cuban son, pop balladry, chanted vocalese—
with lyrics sung in Spalding’s three languages: English,
Portuguese, and Spanish. An ebullient mash-up of
sounds, styles, and tongues, the record seemed like
something new—jazz for the iPod age—and it rose
quickly to No. 3 on the Billboard jazz chart, and stayed
on the chart for sixty-two weeks. The freshness and the
excitement of her approach have led, inevitably, to her
being called the “new hope for jazz.”

Spalding, born in 1984 in Portland, Oregon, to a
single mother of African American, Asian, Native
American, and Hispanic heritage, belongs to a growing
movement of young musicians who have taken a less
traditional approach to the music. For years, young jazz
musicians adopted a near slavish devotion to sounding
like players from jazz’s golden age (anywhere between
the nineteen-twenties and the arrival of the Beatles in
America, in 1964), rejecting the pop, rock, and fusion
experimentation that came in the ninetcen-seventies
and eighties. The members of the Young Lions move-
ment, with Wynton Marsalis the most visible among
them, fetishized staunchly noncommercial “pure” jazz.

Attendance at jazz concerts has been declining for
years; a hit jazz album today might sell forty thousand
copies worldwide. Esperanza has so far sold more than
a hundred thousand. This is, in part, because Spalding
hews closer to dance rhythms than many of her contem-
poraries do. (Jazz has become increasingly compli-
cated, piling on odd meters and abstruse melodies.) It is
also because she sings; for audiences put off by the
cerebral rigors of instrumental improvisation, her pliant
alto voice gives them something to hang on to. But her
original songs sacrifice none of the melodic sophistica-
tion and harmonic interest of jazz; and she is as techni-
cally adept, and as serious a student of the music’s
history, as the most dutiful of the Young Lions.

Spalding is passionate about bringing fresh influ-
ences, voices, and idioms to the music, to prevent jazz
from becoming merely “a museum piece,” as she put it.
In the course of a year, she plays a hundred and fifty
concert dates around the world. In 2009, she played at
the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, in Oslo, Norway. The
schedule sharply limits the time she has for writing new
material and practicing. She moved to Texas last fall in
part because it offers seclusion for working and writing.

ACT-72E

In mid-January, Spalding spent a few days in a
state-of-the-art recording facility in New Jersey, over-

55 seeing the recording of the string arrangements for her
new album, Chamber Music Society. Present at the ses-
sions was Gil Goldstein, a jazz accordion player and
Grammy-winning arranger and producer. Hired as an
arranger for the project, Goldstein had tweaked

60 Spalding’s string parts for the number “Apple Blos-
som.” Although the two had worked smoothly through
most of the session, Spalding balked at the changes to
the song.

“Your string parts are too busy,” Spalding told
65 him, as they sat on a sofa in the studio’s control room.

“Busy?” Goldstein echoed, laughing. “No way!”
“It’s so delicate—I don’t want it to get too dense.”

Spalding insisted on reverting to her earlier, sim-
pler arrangement. Goldstein assented, then went into
70 the soundproofed studio and began conducting the trio
of violin, cello, and viola. But Spalding was not hearing
what she wanted. She took the baton from Goldstein,
who surrendered it without complaint. (He later told me
that he likes it when a musician knows what he or she
75 wants, and that it makes for a better recording.) She put
on headphones and, following the sheet music spread
out in front of her on the conductor’s podium, guided
the musicians through the session. At one point, she
demanded a retake when she wanted the violinist to
80 play a certain note with an upward bow motion, rather
than a downstroke. Later, she asked the violinist to play
a series of notes by plucking the strings. She was unsat-
isfied with the sound.

“Maybe make that plucking more like bells—ting,
85 ting, ting,” she said.

The violinist mimicked the motion she had mimed
at the podium and brought out a bell-like sound.

“Yes!” Spalding said.

21. In general, the author presents Spalding 2

A. an accomplished, versatile musician who is taking
jazz in an exciting new direction.

B. a young and inspiring musician whose explo-
rations in jazz may one day propel her out of her
current obscurity.

C. an overlooked but potentially influential musician
who is discouraged by the decline of jazz.

D. a creative person who stays within the limits of
one musical genre, achieving spectacular results as
a result of her focused efforts.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Silence of the Pikas” by Wendee Holtcamp (©2010 by Wendee
Holtcamp).

Pikas, a diminutive alpine-dwelling rabbit relative,
are unique among alpine mammals in that they gather
up vegetation throughout summer—including flowers,
grasses, leaves, evergreen needles, and even pine

5 cones—and live off the hay pile throughout winter,
rather than hibernating or moving downslope. But
increasingly warm temperatures may drive them to the
brink: the high-energy mammals can overheat and die
at temperatures as mild as 25 degrees Celsius if they

40 can’t regulate their body temperature by moving into
the cooler microclimate under the talus. And since they
already live near the tops of mountains, when a particu-
lar talus field’s microclimate becomes inhospitable,
they simply have nowhere to go.

15 Sometimes called cony, mouse hare, rock rabbit,
or whistling hare, the pika has a narrow niche. They
live only in talus fields, and these must lie adjacent to
alpine meadows or other vegetation so they have access
to plants for food and hay farming. The talus rock fields

20 must have boulders of a certain size; scree, a similar
habitat with smaller rocks, won’t do. Rocks provide
safe haven from pikas’ main predator, weasels. But per-
haps more important, the interstices between the rocks
provide both a cool, moist microclimate where pikas

25 cool down during hot summer days and also the perfect
sanctuary in which to settle during the long winter’s
night. They don’t huddle together like many other
mammals, as far as scientists can tell, but remain
fiercely territorial and solitary throughout the winter,

30 guarding their hay piles with their lives. As a snowpack
settles over the land, it insulates the Earth and main-
tains a certain underground temperature at which pikas
can survive, just below freezing. With warming temper-
atures reducing snowpack in many mountainous areas,

35 in a strange twist of fate, global warming can cause
pikas to freeze.

Biologists have dubbed mountaintop habitat
patches “sky islands” because the valleys in between
are as uninhabitable as the sea for nonmobile alpine

40 species. This creates an ideal scenario to test the pre-
dictions of one of ecology’s key theories: island bio-
geography. Individual pikas have a relatively limited
distance they can disperse, around two kilometers, so
they can’t just shift from one mountain to another. At

45 the population level, they’re stuck on a particular
mountain range. In the 1990s, biologist Erik Beever and
colleagues surveyed pikas throughout the hydrographic
Great Basin—a heart-shaped 500,000 square kilometer
intermontane plateau dotted with 314 mountain ranges,

50 incorporating parts of California, Nevada, Utah,
Oregon, Idaho and Arizona—and were unable to find
pikas in 6 of 25 mountain ranges that they had occupied
in the late 20th century. Was the cause of pika extirpa-
tions (disappearances) climatic, anthropogenic, or

55 biogeographical?

a

ACT-72E

Island biogeography theory says that “species are
predicted to remain on large islands and islands that are
not very isolated from mainland [habitat],” explains
Beever, who did much of his work while a graduate

60 student under Mary Peacock, at the University of
Nevada—Reno. He and colleagues found pika popula-
tions persisted in mountain ranges with more talus
habitat available—supporting one prediction of island
biogeography theory—but pikas were not more likely

65 to persist at sites closer to the Rocky Mountain or
Sierra Nevada “mainland” ranges.

“Here isolation doesn’t have anything to do with
whether they’re lost or not,” Beever says. Not only that,
“the sheer size of a mountain range in this case isn’t

70 very predictive of patterns of loss. [And] if we count
the amount of habitat, that’s less important than these
climatic influences.” Ultimately, the factors most
strongly associated with pika disappearance were cli-
matic; specifically, warmer and drier sites, which

75 tended to be lower down the mountains. In another
study published in Ecological Applications, Beever,
University of Colorado researcher Chris Ray, and other
colleagues revealed that acute cold stress and chronic
heat stress (in other words, cold snaps and overall

80 hotter summers) affect pika more than individual very
hot days.

“The problem with global warming is that if
[pikas] lose [their] snowpack, which provides insula-
tion in winter, they freeze to death, and if the ambient

85 air temperature heats up too much in summer, then they
[overheat]. That’s the challenge,” Peacock says, who
has studied pika population genetics. “They’re already
at the top of the mountain. If you heat it up substan-
tially, there’s no place for them to go.”

31. The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss the:

A. methods scientists use to track the numbers of
pikas in several regions.

B. role pika social behavior plays in their ability to
adapt to changing conditions.

C. causes of pika disappearances and scientists’ pro-
posed solutions to the disappearances.

D. habitat and conditions in which pikas flourish and
the causes of their disappearances.

According to the passage, one of Beever’s findings

that supports island biogeography theory is:

A. pika populations thrived in most of the mountain
ranges that pikas had occupied in the twentieth
century.

B. pika populations endured in mountain ranges with
more talus habitat available.

C. the size of a mountain range correlated with the
size of a pika population.

solated pika populations were more likely to sur-

vive in varied habitats.

According to the passage, the study published in Eco-
logical Applications indicates that a pika population is
most stressed by a summer with:

F. ahigher than average amount of rainfall.

G. several individual very hot days.

H. overall hotter temperatures.

J. slightly cooler temperatures.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that one reason pikas easily overheat is that they:

A. become overwhelmed by a thick snowpack.
B. are a high-energy mammal.

C. huddle together in interstices.

PD. insulate themselves inside hay piles.

The passage indicates that compared to a talus field,
scree habitats have:

F._ more food.

G. fewer predators.

H. smaller rocks.

J. better access to interstices.

The passage indicates that the perfect sanctuary for a
pika on a long winter night is located:

A. ona hay pile near an alpine talus field.

B. in an alpine meadow near a talus field.

C. on the top of a mountain adjacent to a talus field.

D. in the interstices between rocks in an alpine talus
field.

In the passage, the behavior of pikas during winter is
characterized in part as:

F. fiercely territorial.
G. relatively relaxed.
H. predatory.

J. social.

The passage states that biologists dub mountaintop

habitat patches “sky jslands” because:

‘A. any species that survive on mountaintops are com-
pletely cut off from the rest of the mountain.

B. the mountaintops’ altitude makes them a haven for
most species.

C. the valleys between mountaintops are as uninhab-
itable as the sea would be for nonmobile alpine
species.

D. like the sea, mountaintops are only habitable to

Passage |

X-ray spectroscopy is a way of analyzing a mineral’s
composition. When an electron beam is directed onto a
mineral, each element in the mineral emits characteristic
X-rays having a narrow range of energies. The intensity of
all X-rays emitted by the clements is measured. The greater
the maximum intensity of the X-rays emitted by an ele-
ment, the greater the relative concentration of the element
in the mineral.

Figures 1 and 2 show X-ray spectroscopy results for
Mineral | and Mineral 2, respectively, under identical con-
ditions. Energy is given in kiloelectron volts (keV); inten-
sity is given in counts per second (sec).

In red blood cells (RBCs), the protein hemoglobin
(Hb) carries oxygen. Each Hb molecule contains 4 globin
polypeptides—a pair of P-type globins and a pair of Q-type
globins. The possible combinations of the P-type globin
and the Q-type globin for the 3 variants of human Hb are
shown in Table I. For each combination, the notation is of
the form (P-type)2(Q-type)2.

Passage Ill

Prey can use visual cues and/or chemical cues to iden-
tify predators. Students conducted 2 experiments to deter-
mine if visual cues and/or chemical cues affected how
guppies (a prey fish) responded to cichlids (a guppy
predator).

Experiment 1

Four identical tanks (Tanks 1-4) were filled with
water. A barrier was placed in each tank to divide each tank
into 2 equal halves, the predator half and the prey half. The
type of barrier was different for each tank (see Table 1).
Three regions (Regions X—Z), each 10 cm wide, were des-
ignated in the prey half of each tank (see diagram).

A guppy was added to the prey half of each tank, and
a cichlid was added to the predator half of each tank. The
guppy in each tank was observed every 15 sec for the next
5 min, and the region in which the guppy was located at the
time of each observation was recorded. Then, the percent

A student hypothesized that when no cues were trans-
mitted through the barrier, the percent of observations
in Region Y would be the same regardless of the
number of guppies in the tank. Are the results of

percent of observations to the region with the smallest
percent of observations?

F. Region Y, Region X, Region Z
G. Region Y, Region Z, Region X
H. Region Z, Region X, Region ¥

A student hypothesized that any guppy receiving visual
cues would stay as far away from a predator as possi-
ble. Are the results of Experiment 1 consistent with
this hypothesi

Yes; in Experiment 1, neither the guppy in Tank 2
nor the guppy in Tank 4 was observed in Region X.
Yes; in Experiment 1, neither the guppy in Tank 1
nor the guppy in Tank 3 was observed in Region Z.
No; in Experiment 1, both the guppy in Tank 2 and
the guppy in Tank 4 were observed in Region X.

No; in Experiment 1, both the guppy in Tank | and
the guppy in Tank 3 were observed in Region Z.

The students conducting the experiments made which
of the following assumptions about chemical cues?

Chemical cues were not produced by the cichlids
when a barrier was present.

Chemical cues were not produced by the cichlids
when a barrier was absent.

Chemical cues could diffuse through the barriers
without perforations.

Passage IV

Using the equipment shown in Figure 1, a group of
students performed 3 experiments involving pendulums in
motion. Each pendulum consisted of a bob of mass M sus-
pended from a rigid support by a string of length L.

Figure |

At the start of each trial, the students displaced the
bob to a selected angle, 8, measured from the vertical,
using a protractor fastened to the support. The students
then released the bob from rest, allowing it to swing back
and forth. They used a stopwatch to measure the period. T,
of the pendulum, defined as the time required for the bob to
complete | full swing (from Point A to Point B and back to
Point A).

Before each experiment, the students derived an equa-
tion, based on the laws of physics, to predict T for each
trial of that experiment. Then, after obtaining their mea-
surements, the students graphed their predicted T data and
their measured T data.

Experiment 1

A pendulum with M= 100g and L= 100 cm was
released from rest at various values of @, in degrees. The
pendulum was timed for 10 full swings and the measured
time was then divided by 10 to obtain a measured aver-
age T, in seconds (sec), for each 0 (see Figure 2D)

When vinegar (a solution of acetic acid, CH,COOH,
in H,O) is mixed with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate,
NaHCO), the following reaction occurs:

CH,COOH + NaHCO, > CH;COONa + H,0 + CO,

A teacher constructed the apparatus shown in Figure 1
for a demonstration. First, 30 mL of vinegar was poured
into a bottle. Then, 5 g of baking soda was placed in a bal-
loon. The balloon was affixed to the top of the bottle with
wire to form an airtight seal.

‘The apparatus was placed on a balance, and the mass
reading was 68.7 g. The balloon was then lifted up so that
all the baking soda fell into the bottle. As bubbles formed
in the bottle, the balloon inflated and the mass reading on
the balance steadily decreased. When the reaction was fin-
ished, the mass reading was 68.1 g (see Figure 2).

The teacher asked 3 students to explain what occurred
in the demonstration. The students agreed that the balloon

reaction mixture. They disagreed about why the mass read-
ing on the balance decreased.

ACT-72E

46

Student 1

No gas exited the apparatus because it was airtight.
Gases, however, have no mass, so as CO, was produced,
the mass of the apparatus decreased.

Student 2

Gases have mass, so the mass of the apparatus should
not have changed. A balloon, however, will deflate over
time because there are tiny pores in its surface. Due to the
rapid pressure increase in the apparatus, a measurable mass
of CO, exited through the pores in the quickly expanding
balloon, which caused the mass of the apparatus to
decrease.

Student 3

Gases have mass, and although there are tiny pores in
a balloon’s surface, there was not enough time for a mea-
surable mass of gases to have exited the balloon. The air
exerted an upward buoyant force on the apparatus that was
equal to the weight of the volume of air that was displaced
by the apparatus. As the balloon inflated, the volume of the
apparatus increased, causing it to displace a greater volume
of air. Thus, the buoyant force increased, which caused the
mass reading on the balance to decrease. The actual mass
of the apparatus did not measurably change.

23. The explanation given by which student, if any, is
inconsistent with the law of conservation of mass?

A. Student 1

B. Student 2

C. Student 3

D. None of the students

H. Students | and 2 only

As the balloon inflated, did the mass of acetic acid in
the bottle increase or decrease?

‘A. Increase, because acetic acid was being consumed.
B. Increase, because acetic acid was being produced.

C. Decrease, because acetic acid was being consumed.
D. Decrease, because acetic acid was being produced.

Passage VII

In a particular estuary (an inlet where ocean water and
river water mix), the sediment contains the radioactive iso-
topes lead-210 (7!°Pb) and cesium-137 ('°’Cs). The iso-
topes are components of particles that fall from the air into
the estuary. Unlike 7°Pb, '*’Cs is produced only by human
activities. It has been detectable in the estuary sediment
since 1954, the year it was first found in Earth’s atmo-
sphere. In 2003, 2 studies examined *'°Pb and '*’Cs con-
centrations in the estuary sediment.

At each of 2 sites (Site 1 and Site 2), 4 cylindrical ver-
tical cores of the sediment, each 5.0 cm in diameter and
40 cm in length, were collected. Each core’s sediment was
sampled at the top and then every 2 cm down the core’s
length. The Site 1 samples from the same depth in each
core were combined, and the Site 2 samples from the same
depth in each core were combined.

Study 1

A portion of each combined sample was analyzed to
determine the *°Pb concentration in becquerels per kilo-
gram of sediment (Bq/kg). (One becquerel is equivalent to
1 nuclear decay per second.) The results are shown in
Figure 1.

Study 2

Another portion of each combined sample was ana-
lyzed to determine the ‘*’Cs concentration (see Figure 2).
The '*’Cs data indicated the total thickness of sediment that
had been deposited at each site from 1954 to 2003. Then,
the average sediment accumulation rate over that period
was calculated for each site. The Site 1 rate was
0.41 cm/yr; the Site 2 rate was 0.37 cm/yr.

B. between 30 Bq/kg and 45 Bq/kg.
C. between 45 Baq/kg and 60 Ba/kg.
D. greater than 60 Bq/kg.
38. According to the results of Study 1, at Site 2, the con-
centration of *'°Pb in the sample of surface sediment
was how many times as great as the concentration of
21°Pb in the sample from a depth of 10 cm ?
F._ Less than 0.5
G. 0.5
H. 2.0
J. More than 2.0

39. Based on the information provided, why was no '*’Cs
present in the Site 1 and Site 2 sediments at a depth of
30cm?

A. All the '*’Cs in the sediments had decayed.
B. All the '*’Cs in the sediments had reacted with
other elements.

C. The sediments at that depth were deposited before
1954.

D. The sediments at that depth were deposited after
1954.

40. In Study 2, the average sediment accumulation rate for
Site 2 was calculated using which of the following
expressions?

F, 18cm+49 yr

G. 49 yr + 18cm

H. 40cm +49 yr

J. 49 yr +40cm

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
