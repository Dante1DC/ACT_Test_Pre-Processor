ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the styie and tone of the passage
as awhole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

traditions,
In the late nineteenth century, German immigrants to

south Texas and northern Mexico brought with them their

dance music | 1s | and the button accordion. The music and

the instrument were adopted by musicians in that region,

who began to use the avcordion, in their own dance music,
3
huapangos and rancheras. At the same time, the

Spanish and English folk ballad traditions took root
in Tejano music in the form of corridos, narrative
songs of bravery, romance, and tragedy set in the

towns and ranches of the region. Eventually, a unique

musical style developed; based on duet singing and

an instrumentation of accordion, drums, upright bass,

and bajo sexto, the Spanish twelve-string bass guitar.

It was conjunto and became the heart of Tejano music.

Lydia Mendoza. [2] She was born in Mexico in 1916, but

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel
Monkey Bridge by Lan Cao (©1997 by Lan Cao). The story is
Selin the late 1970s in Virginia, where the narrator and her
Mother have moved from Vietnam after the fall of Saigon

1 discovered soon after my arrival in Virginia that
everything, even the simple business of shopping the
American way, unsettled my mother’s nerves. From the
outside, it had been an ordinary building that held no
promises or threats. But inside, the A & P brimmed
with unexpected abundance. Metal stands overflowed
with giant oranges and meticulously arranged grape-
fruits. Columns of canned vegetables and fruits stood
among multiple shelves as people well rehearsed to the
io demands of modern shopping meandered through

florescent aisies. | remembered the sharp chilled air
against my face, the way the hydraulic door made a
sucking sound as it closed behind.

a

My mother did not appreciate the exacting orderli-
ness of the A & P. She could not give in to the preci-
sion of previously weighed and packaged food, the
bloodlessness of beef slabs in translucent wrappers, the
absence of carcasses and pigs’ heads. When we were in
Saigon, there were only outdoor markets. “Sky mar-
20 kets,” they Were cailed, vast, prosperous expanses in
the middle of the city where barrels of live crabs and
yellow carps and booths of ducks and geese would be
stacked side by side with cardboard stands of expensive
silk fabric. It was always noisy there—a voluptuous

25 mix of animal and human sounds. The sharp acrid smell
of gutters choked by the monsoon rain. The odor of
horses, partially camouflaged by the scent of guavas
and bananas.

1

a

My mother knew the vendors and the shoppers by
30 name and would take me from stall to stail to expose
me to her skills. They were all addicted to each other's
oddities. My mother would feign indifference and they
would inevitably call out to her. She would heed their
call and they would immediately retreat into sudden
apathy. They knew my mother’s slick bargaining skills,
and she, in turn, knew how to navigate with grace
through their extravagant prices and rehearsed hut:
ness. Theirs had been a mating dance, a match of wills.

3

&

Every morning, we drifted from vendor to vendor.
40 Tables ful! of shampoo and toothpaste were pocketed

326 Wwww.actexam.net

among vegetable stands one day and jars of herbs the
next, The market was randomly organized, and only the
mighty and experienced like my mother could navigate
its patternless paths.

45 But with a sense of neither drama nor calamity,
my mother’s ability to navigate and decipher simply
became undone in our new life. She preferred the
improvisation of haggling to the conventional certainty
of discount coupons, the primordial messiness and fish-
mongers’ stink of the open-air market to the aroma-free
order of individually wrapped fillets.

Sl

Now, a mere three and a half years or so after her

call to the sky market, the dreadful truth was simply

we were going through life in reverse, and I was

s5 the one who would help my mother through the hard
scrutiny of ordinary suburban life. 1 would have to forgo
the luxury of adolescent experiments and temper
tantrums, so that I could scoop my mother out of harm’s
way and give her sanctuary. Now, when we stepped into

60 the exterior world, I was the one who told my mother
what was acceptable or unacceptable behavior.

All children of immigrant parents have experi-
enced these moments. When it first occurs, when the
parent first reveals the behavior of a child, is a defining

65 moment. Of course, all children eventually watch their
parents’ astonishing return to the vulnerability of child-
hood, but for us the process begins much earlier than
expected.

“We don’t have to pay the moment we decide to

70 buy the pork. We can put as much as we want in the

cart and pay only once, at the checkout counter.” It

took a few moments’ hesitation for my mother to suc-
cumb to the peculiarity of my explanation.

“T can take you in this aisle,” a store clerk offered
75 as she unlocked a new register to accommodate the
long line of customers. She gestured us to “come over
here” with an upturned index finger, a disdainful hook
we Vietnamese use to summon dogs. My mother did
not understand the ambiguity of American hand
ures. In Vietnam, we said “Come here” to humans
rently, with our palm up and all four fingers waved
in unison—the way people over here waved goodbye.

“Even the store:clerks look down on us,” my
mother grumbled. This was a truth I was only begin-

ning to realize: it was not the enormous or momentous
event, but the gradual suggestion of irrevocable and
protracted change that threw us off balance and made
us know in no uncertain terms that we would not be
returning to the familiarity of our former lives.

. Atthe time of the events of the story, the narrator is:

A

an adult remembering how hard it was on her

mother when the two of them visited the United

States from Saigon.

an adult planning to take her mother back to their

native Saigon after an unsuccessful trip to the

United States.

C. an adolescent imagining what it had been like

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from Joseph
Ellis's biography American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson (©1997 by Joseph J. Ellis).

The most famous section of the Declaration of
Independence, which has become the most quoted
statement of human rights in recorded history as well as
the most eloquent justification of revolution on behalf
of them, went through the Continental Congress
without comment and with only one very minor change.
These are, in all probability, the best-known fifty-eight
words in American history: “We hold these truths to be
self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they
10 are endowed by their Creator with certain inherent and

inalienable Rights; that among these are life, Jiberty
and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed.” This is
15 the seminal statement of the American Creed, the
closest approximation to political poetry ever produced
in American culture. In the nineteenth century Abraham
Lincoln, who also knew how to change history with
words, articulated with characteristic eloquence the
20 quasi-religious view of Thomas Jefferson as the orig-
inal American oracle: “All honor to Jefferson—to the
man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for
national independence by a single people, had the coo!-
ness, forecaste, and capacity to introduce into a merely
28 revolutionary document, an abstract truth, and so to
embalm it there, that today and in all coming days, it
shall be a rebuke and a stumbling block to the very har-
bingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression.”

o

No serious student of either Jefferson or the
30 Declaration of Independence has ever claimed that he
foresaw all or even most of the ideological conse-
quences of what he wrote. But the effort to explain
what was in his head has spawned almost as many
interpretations as the words themselves have generated
36 political movements. Jefferson himself was accused of
plagiarism by enemies or jealous friends on so many
occasions throughout his career that he developed a
standard reply. “Neither aiming at originality of prin-
ciple or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular
40 and previous writing.” he explained, he drew his ideas
from “the harmonizing sentiments of the day, whether
expressed in letters, printed essays or in the elementary
books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke,
Sidney, etc.”

322

45 This is an ingeniously double-edged explanation,
for it simultaneously disavows any claims to originality
and yet insists that he depended upon no specific texts
or sources. The image it conjures up is that of a
medium, sitting alone t at the writing desk and making

50 himself into an instrument for the accumulated wisdom
and “harmonizing sentiments” of the ages. It is only a
short step from this image to Lincoln’s vision of
Jefferson as oracle or prophet, receiving the message
from the gods and sending it on to us and then to the

55 ages. Given the character of the natural rights section of
the Declaration, several generations of American inter-
preters have felt the irresistible impulse to bathe the
scene in speckled light and cloudy mist, thereby
implying that efforts to dispel the veil of mystery rep-

60 resent some vague combination of sacrilege and
treason.

Any serious attempt to pierce through this veil
must begin by recovering the specific conditions inside
that room on Market and Seventh streets in June 1776.

65 Even if we take Jefferson at his word, that he did not
copy sections of the Declaration from any particular
books, he almost surely had with him copies of his own
previous writings, to include Summary View, Causes
and Necessities and his three drafts of the Virginia con-

70 stitution. This is not to accuse him of plagiarism, unless
one wishes to argue that an author can plagiarize him-
self. It is to say that virtually all the ideas found in the
Declaration and much of the specific language had
already found expression in those earlier writings.

75 Recall the context. The Congress is being over-
whelmed with military reports of imminent American
defeat in New York and Canada. The full Congress is in
session six days a week, and committees are meeting
throughout the evenings. The obvious practical course

80 for Jefferson to take was to rework his previous drafts
on the same general theme. While it seems almost sac-
rilegious to suggest that, the creative process that pro-
duced the Declaration was a cut-and-paste job, it strains
credulity and common sense to the breaking point to

85 believe that Jefferson did not have these items at his
elbow and draw liberally from them when drafting the
Declaration,

ii. It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the
author believes that Jefferson was:

A. a mysterious character whose attempts at original-
ity were very patriotic.

B. a brilliant yet practical man, neither plagiarizer
nor prophet, writing under pressure.

€. a politician who deserves more attention for his
writing than he gets.

BD. an average man who has been represented as a
quasi-religious leader by later generations.

Details in the passage suggest that the euthor’s per-

sonal position on the question of Jefferson’s alleged

plagiarism is that the:

F. idea of Jefferson copying from his own writings is
only common sense.

G. notion of Jefferson copying from past writings is
in fact sacrilegious.

HZ. concept of the Declaration as a cut-and-paste job
strains credulity.

Which of the following statements best summarizes
Lincoln’s thoughts about what Jefferson achieved
when he wrote the Declaration (lines 21-28)?

F. Even during the fight for independence,
Jefferson’s cool intelligence allowed him to write
a statement that has been used against revolution-
aries ever since.

G. Even during a revolution, Jefferson was calm
enough to change a merely political document into
a statement that predicted the rise of future tyrants.

H. Even under pressure of war, Jefferson was able to
write a document that not,-only announced a
revolution but also spoke against oppression for ali
time.

J. Even under pressure of war, Jefferson was able to
write a document that both proclaimed abstract
truths and dared tyrants to continually reappear.

The main function of the second paragraph (lines 29-44)
in relation to the passage as a whole is to:

A. redirect the passage toward a discussion of various
interpretations of the Declaration.

B. establish the passage’s claim that Jefferson
receives a great deal of serious scholarly attention
for many of his writings.

{In saying “Even if we take Jefferson at his word, that
he did not copy sections of the Declaration from any
particular books” (lines 65-67), the author implies that
he thinks Jefferson:

F. may not have been totally honest whea he said that
no parts of the Declaration were copied from any
previous writing.
may have in fact copied some of Abraham
Lincoln’s writings when drafting the Declaration.
H. should not be believed because his character has
been hidden behind a veil of mystery for so long.
J. cannot be accused of plagiarizing parts of the
Declaration because it was written so long ago.

Use of the phrase characteristic eloquence (line 19) to
describe Abraham Lincoln’s words indicates the
author’s:

A. use of irony to describe words written by Lincoln
that the author finds difficult to believe.

B. belief that Lincoln was usually a persuasive,
expressive speaker and writer,
notion that Lincoln was a bit of a character
because of his controversial opinions.

D. feelings of regret that Lincoln’s words are so often
difficult for modern readers to understand.

According to lines 29-32, students of Jefferson and of
the Declaration think that Jefferson:

F. carefully contrived to write ambiguously about

The author thinks Jefferson's reply to accusations of
plagiarism was “ingeniously double-edged” (line 45)
because Jefferson claimed that:

A. he wrote alone, while also implying that he copied
from his own previous writings.

B. his work was prophetic, yet he made no claim to
originality.

C. he was a prophet, and he later influenced Lincoln
to agree with that claim.

D. his writing was not new, yet he maintained he had
not copied from any particular text.

The author uses the description of what was happening
in the country when Jefferson was writing the Declara~
tion (lines 75-79) to suggest that Jefferson:

F. felt great urgency to get the Declaration written,
and didn’t have much time to do so.

G._was depressed by news of American defeats and so
Jacked energy to draft a new document.

H. knew the Declaration could solve the problems of
the nation and finished it in a hurry.

J. worried that the war was moving closer to home and
felt he should take his time writing the Declaration.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the essay
“Spaced Out: The Star Trek Literary Phenomenon: Where No
‘TV Series Has Gone Before” by Michael M. Epstein, which
appeared in Television Quarterly (©1996 by The National
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences).

On September 8, 1966, when NBC premiered its
new futuristic series, Star Trek, few were watching.
Conceived by television writer Gene Roddenberry as
part American Western, part science fiction, and part
contemporary morality play, Star Trek languished for
two and a half years before being canceled as a ratings
flop in January 1969.

a

Two years later, Star Trek somehow had captured
the imagination and viewer loyalty of millions of
10 Americans who “discovered” the show anew in syndi-
cated reruns. Star Trek’s meteoric rise to popularity
was unprecedented for a television program. By
January 1972, the show was airing in over one hundred
local markets in America and seventy more around the

15 world.

Perhaps more than other television series, Star
Trek benefited greatly from being the right show at
the right time. In middle-class America, social and
political change in the late 1960s made it increasingly
difficult for people to unite in common purpose. Civil
rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and the rise of a
culturally empowered youth movement, among other
things, divided many Americans by race, gender, age,
and politics.

25 Although television news programs helped focus
the country on the rifts that had begun to percolate on
campuses, in city streets, and around dining room
tables, as a rule entertainment programming avoided
conflict and controversy. Escapist comedy about sub-

30 urban witches, genies, and rural townspeople was stan-

. dard fare. Network drama emphasized law, order, and
conformity, whether on the police beat, in a courtroom,
or out on the great Western frontier.

Star Trek was different. Created in the optimistic

35 afterglow of John F. Kennedy’s inauguration of the

space race, Star Trek’s exploration of the “final fron-

tier” was a theme that resonated with millions of ideal-

istic and awestruck Americans who looked at the

Apollo moon landings as'a crowning, positive achieve-

40 ment for humankind. Still, as Gene Roddenberry often

claimed, Star Trek was less about the future than the
present.

Indeed, it was precisely because of its futuristic
storyline that Star Trek was able to address many of the

45 contemporary social problems that other programs
shunned. Star Trek’s visionary episodes on race rela-
tions, nuclear deterrence, multiculturalism, and ecology
(among others) were not threatening to those who saw
it as fantastic science fiction. For those who saw the
50 program as a window into current controversy, Star
Trek ‘offered insight and added perspective to continued

Star Trek has had on an industry that has only recently
become television friendly: publishing. Since the early
1970s, when the first novels hit bookshelves, the world
of Star Trek has exploded in print like no other phe-

volumes, cast memoirs, and novels continue to
appear—and in record numbers.

‘Of all the “classic” and contemporary shows avail-

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from An
Anthropologist on Mars by Oliver Sacks (©1995 by Oliver
Sacks). Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was an eighteenth-
century German poet and philosopher; Hermann von Helmholtz
was a nineteenth-century scientist and philosopher.

Goethe’s color theory, his Farbenlehre (which he
regarded as the equal of his entire poetic opus), was, by
and large, dismissed by all his contemporaries and has
remained in a sort of Jimbo ever since, seen as the
whimsy, the pseudoscience, of a very great poct. But
science itself was not entirely insensitive to the “anom-
alies” that Goethe considered central, and Helmholtz,
indeed, gave admiring lectures on Goethe and his sci-
ence, on many occasions—the Jast in’ 1892. Helmholtz
0 was very conscious of “color constancy” —the way in
which the colors of objects are preserved, so that we
can categorize them and always know what we are
looking at, despite great fluctuations in the wavelength
of the light illuminating them. The actual wavelengths
reflected by an apple, for instance, will vary consider-
ably depending on the illumination, but we consistently
see it as red, nonethcless. This could not be, clearly, a
mere translation of wavelength into color. There had to
be some way, Helmholtz thought, of “discounting the

a

a

20 illurinant”—and this he saw as an “unconscious infer-

ence” or “an act of judgement” (though he did not ven-
ture to suggest where such judgement might occur).
Color constancy, for him, was a special example of the
way in which we achieve perceptual constancy gener-

25 ally, make a stable perceptual world from a chaotic sen-

sory flux—a world that would not be possible if our
perceptions were merely passive reflections of the
unpredictable and inconstant input that bathes our
receptors.

30 Heimholtz’s great contemporary, James Clerk

Maxwell, had aiso been fascinated by the mystery of
color vision from his student days. He formalized the
notions of primary colors and color mixing by the
invention of a color top (the colors of which fused,

35 when it was spun, to yield a sensation of grey). and a

graphic representation with three axes, a color triangle,
which showed how any color could be created by di
ferent mixtures of the three primary colors. These pre-
pared the way for his most spectacular demonstration,

40 the demonstration in 1861 that color photography was

45

possible, despite the fact that photographic emulsions
were themselves black and white. He did this by pho-
tographing a colored bow three times, through red,
green, and violet filters. Having obtained three “color-
separation” images, as he called them, he now brought
these together by superimposing them upon a screen,
projecting each image through its corresponding filter
(the image taken through the red filter was projected
with red light, and so on). Suddenly, the bow burst

50 forth in full color. Clerk Maxwell wondered if this was

how colors were perceived in the brain, by the addition
of color-separation images or their neural correlates
[what functions in the brain as a color-separation
image], as in his magic-lantern demonstrations.

326

Clerk Maxwell himself was acutely aware of the
drawback of this additive process: color photography
had no way of “discounting the illuminant,” and its
colors changed helplessly with changing wavelengths
of light. :

In 1957, ninety-odd years after Clerk Maxwell’s
famous demonstration, Edwin Land—not merely the
inventor of the instant Land camera and Polaroid, but
an experimenter and theorizer of genius—provided a
photographic demonstration of color perception even
more startling. Unlike Clerk Maxwell, he mace only
two black-and-white images (using a split-beam camera
so they could be taken at the same time from the same
viewpoint, through the same lens) and superimposed
these on a screen with a double-lens projector. He used
two filters to make the images: one passing longer’
wavelengths (a red filter), the other passing shorter
wavelengths (a green filter). The first image was then
projected through a red filter, the second with ordinary
white light, unfiltered. One might expect that this

75 would produce just an overall pale-pink image, but

something “impossible” happened instead. The photo-
graph of a young woman appeared instantly in full
color—‘‘blonde hair, pale blue eyes, red coat, bluegreen
collar, and strikingly natural flesh tones,” as Land later

80 described it. Where did these colors come from, how

were they made? They did not seem to be “in” the pho-
tographs or the illuminants themselves. These demon-
strations, overwhelming in their simplicity and impact,
were color “illusions” in Goethe’s sense, but illusions

85 that demonstrated a neurological truth—that colors are

not “out there” in the world, nor (as classical theory
held) an automatic correlate of wavelength, but, rather,
are constructed by the brain.

31. According to the passage, regarding Goethe’s color

theory, Helmholtz expressed which of the following
attitudes?

A. Disbelief

B. Respect

Cc. Amusement

D. Skepticism

32. It can be inferred that in Clerk Maxwell's 1861 demon-

stration a color image would not have been produced
from black-and-white film emulsions without the use
of color:

As described in the passage, Goethe’s contemporaries
for the most part regarded him as a:

A. mediocre poet whose most important work was as
a scientist.

B. theorist whose attempts at poetry were commend-

able but insignificant.

leading poet whose contributions to science were

less noteworthy.

D. leading theorist who overturned previously stan-
dard approaches to scientific inquiry.

The tendency to perceive objects as’having a given
color, such as the perception of an apple as “red” eyen
if itis “red” only in certain lighting, is an example of
what Helmholtz refers to as:

FE. split-beam filtering.

G. sensory flux.

H. color separation.

J. color constancy.

According to lines }4-17, the wavelengths reflected by

the apple vary considerably as a result of:

A. the differences between the viewer’s right and left
eye.

B. the distance between the apple and the eyes.

C. a viewer's ability to perceive red in different light.

BD. variations in the source of light reaching the apple.

The term illuminant, as it is used in line 20 and else-
where in the passage, refers to which of the following?

F. Camera flash equipment

G. A color theorist

H. Light that makes an object visible

J. Light before it passes through a filter

What about the nature of color perception is described
as a preoccupation of Helmholtz’s? The way in which:

A. varying wavelengths of light stabilize the appear-
ance of an object.

B. humans arrive at a notion of what the color of an
object is.

C. humans undergo changes in color awareness as
they age.

D. one color becomes another when images are super-
imposed.

primary colors and other colors can be best described
by which of the following statements?

F, All colors are either primary colors or can be cre-
ated by a combination of primary color:

G. The human eye perceives primary colors first, then
other colors.

H. Primary colors were the first colors captured on
film by the camera; other colors were capturecl by
later, more sophisticated, equipment.

J. Primary colors emerge as a result of blending
nonprimary colors along the axes of Clerk
Maxwell’s triangle.

39. Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that color photography

was possible even though at the time of his demonstra-

tions:

A. illuminants were thought to be stable rather than
variable.

B. photographic emulsions were available only in
black-and-white.

C. the general public rejected the new technology as
stunts with no practical application.

D. professional photographers were reluctant to
abandon the established black-and-white aesthetic.

Land’s photograph of a woman were obtained by
using:

Passage Il

Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is toxic in air at concen-
trations above 0.1% by volume. Cars are the major source
of atmospheric CO in urban areas. Higher CO levels are
observed during colder weather. A group of students pro-
posed that cars emit more CO at colder air temperatures
than at warmer air temperatures during the first 15 minutes
after they are started. The students did the following exper-
iments to investigate this hypothesis.

Experiment |

A hose was connected to the tailpipe of a car. The
engine was started and the exhaust was collected in a
plastic bag. A | mL sample of the exhaust was taken from
the bag with a syringe and injected into a gas chromato-
graph, m instrument that separates a mixture of gases into
its individual components. Comparisons of the exhaust
with mixtures of known CO concentrations were made to
determine the percent by volume of CO in the exhaust.
Exhaust was collected at 2-minute intervals. Samples of
exhaust from each of 4 cars were tested at an external tem-
perature of —9°C. The results are shown in Table |.

using the procedure from Experiment 1. The results are
shown in Table 2.

6. Do the results from Experiment ! support the hypoth-
esis that, at a given temperature and time, the exhaust
of newer cars contains lower percents of CO than the
exhaust of older cars?

F. Yes; the highest percent of CO was in the exhaust
of the 1996 Model Y.

G. Yes; both 1996 models had percents of CO that
were lower than those of either 1978 model.

H. No; the highest percent of CO was in the exhaust
of the 1978 Model Y.
No; both 1978 models had percents of CO that
were lower than those of either 1996 model.

7. A student, when using the gas chromatograph, was
concerned that CO, in the exhaust sample may be
interfering in the detection of CO. Which of the
following procedures would best help the student
investigate this problem?

A. Filling the bag with CO, before collecting the
exhaust

Passage ill

Astudent performed 3 activities with a microscope
that had 4 objective lenses.

Activity 1

The student viewed 4 slides (A, B, C, and D) through
each objective lens. Bach slide had 2 thin lines painted on
it. Foreach objective lens, the student determined whether
she could see the lines as separate ot whether they blurred
into | image. The results appear in Table 1.

Table 1
Objective Lens:
Slide 17/213 4) 4
A | \ | |
B | | | i
c | ! jt
D | oe il
Note: || indicates lines appeared separate;
‘| indicates lines blurred together.

Activity 2 .

The student was given a prepared slide with a line on
it that was 0.1 mm in length. This length was defined as the
object size. Next, she viewed the slide with each objective
lens, estimating how long the line appeared. This estimated
length was called the image size. Finally, she calculated the
magnification (M) associated with each objective Jens from
the “following formula:

M = image size + object size.

The data appear in Table 2.

Table 2
Objective Lens | Image size (mm) | M
1 4 . 40
2 10 100
3 20 200
4 40 400 |

332

Activity 3

The numerical aperture (NA) of each objective lens
was printed on the microscope. NA determines how much
detail can be seen and is related to resolution (R). R is
defined as the smailest distance separating 2 objects such
that the objects appear separate. Thus an objective lens
with a small R shows a sampie more cleariy than does an
objective lens with a large R.R is calculated from the fol-
lowing formula:

R=2+2(NA)

where A is the wavelength of the light, in nanometers (nm),
used to view the objects.

The student calculated R for each objective lens,
assuming a A of 550 nm. The data appear in Table 3.

Table 3
Objective Lens | = NA R (nm)
! 0.10 2,150
2 0.25 L100
3 0.40 688
4 0.65 423

42. If the student had viewed the slide used in Activity 2
through a fifth objective lens and the image size with
this objective lens was 30 mm, the M associated with
this objective lens would have been:

BR 30.
G. 100.
H. 300.
J. 1,000.

13. Based on the results of Activity 2, the combination of
which of the following lines and objective lenses
would result in the greatest image size?

A. A0.7 mm line viewed through Objective Lens 1
B. A 0.6 mm line viewed through Objective Lens 2
C. A0.5 mm line viewed through Objective Leas 3

Passage IV

_  Ablackbody is an object that absorbs all of the radia-
tion that strikes it. The blackbody also emits radiation at all
wavelengths; the emitted radiation is called blackbody
radiation. The brightness of blackbody radiation at a given
wavelength depends on the temperature of the biackbody.
A graph of brightness versus wavelength for a blackbody is
called 4 blackbody curve. Blackbody curves for the same
blackbody at 3 different temperatures are shown in the

Passage V

Some of the liquid in a closed container evaporates,
forming a vapor that condenses, reforming the liquid. The
pressure of the vapor at equilibrium (when the rates of
evaporation and condensation are equal) is the liquid’s
vapor pressure. A liquid in an open container boils when its
vapor pressure equals the external pressure. The following
experiments were performed to study vapor pressures.

Experiment 1

The apparatus shown in Figure | was assembled
except for the tubing. The flask was placed in a 20°C H,O
bath. After 5 minutes the manometer was connected, and
2 mL of hexane was added to the flask from the dropper.
Some of the hexane evaporated. The vapor pressure was
determined by measuring the height of the mercury (Hg)
after the Hg level had stabilized. Additional trials were
performed at different temperatures and with other liquids
in the flask. The results are shown in Table 1.

Passage VI

O

Apotypeptide molecule is a chain of amino acids. A
protein consists of { or more polypeptides. A protein's
shape is described by 3 or 4 levels of structure.

4. The primary structure of a protein is the sequence
of amino acids in each polypeptide.

The secondary structure of a protein is the local
Folding patterns within short segments of each

polypeptide due to hydrogen bonding (weak chem-
ical bonds).

O

3. The tertiary structure is the folding patterns that
result from interactions between dmino acid side
chains (parts of an amino acid) in each polypep-
tide. These folding patterns generally occur across
greater distances than those associated with the
secondary structure.

=

~The guaternary structure is the result of the clus-
tering between more than | folded polypeptide.

A protein can adopt different shapes, and each shape
has a telative energy. Lower-energy shapes are more stable
than tigher-energy shapes, and a protein with a relatively
high-energy. shape may denature (unfold) and then renature
(refold), adopting a more stable shape. A protein that is
almost completely denatured is called a random coil.
Random coils are unstable because they are high-energy

shapes; however, some can renature, adopting more stable
shapes.

Two scientists discuss protein shape.

Scientist 1

The active shape (the biologically functional shape) of
a protein is always identical to the protein’s lowest-energy
shape. Any other shape would be unstable. Because a
protein’s lowest-energy shape is determined by its
structure, its active shape is determined by it
structure

primary

Scientist 2

The active shape of a protein is dependent upon its
primary structure. However, a protein’s active shape may
. also depend on its process of synthesis, the order {in time)
in which the amino acids were bonded together. As syn-
thesis occurs, stable, local structures form within short seg-
ments of the polypeptide chain due to hydrogen bonding.
These local structures may be different than the local struc-
tures associated with the protein’s lowest-energy shape.
After synthesis, these structures persist, trapping the pro-
tein in an active shape that has more energy than its
lowest-energy shape.

Suppose proteins are almost completely denatured and
then ailowed to renature in a way that allows them to
have their lowest-energy shapes. Which of the fol-
lowing statements about the proteins is most consistent
with the information presented in the passage?

A.

If Scientist | is correct, all of the proteins will
have their active shapes.

Tiny marine organisms build shells from calcite
(CaCO) dissolved in scawater. After the organisms’ death,
the shells sink. Some shells dissolve before they reach
the seafloor, but some form layers of calcareous ooze
(CaCOy-rich sediment). Figure | shows how seawater’s
degree of saturation with respect to CaCO, and the rate at
