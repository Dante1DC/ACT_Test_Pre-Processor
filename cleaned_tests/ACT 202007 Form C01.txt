ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |
A Mouthful of Music
Mouth music is the name given in English to the many
ways by imitating the sounds of musical instruments with
1

the human voice. Forms of mouth music are performed

around the world, but the genre being particularly popular

in England, Ireland, and Scotland. In this Celtic region,
lilting and jigging are two of the lively names used to
refer to this musical form.

Celtic mouth music exists to accompany
dancing, so the rhythms and sounds are

first-class and the words take a back seat.

3
Instead of using traditional lyrics, singers often

produce nonsense syllables, called vocables to
represent specific instrumental sounds, such as
those of bagpipes or violins. The results are songs
that rarely make literal sense but nevertheless flow

PASSAGE Ill
Neutrinos on Ice
At the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica,
eighty-six cables descend 2,500 meters down into the

n
glacial terrain. Each cable is equipped with sixty digital

optical modules (DOMs), which, are programmed, to
detect a faint blue flash known ie Chereakoy radiation.
This radiation: a veritable shock wave of photonic
ces emitted when subatomic particles called
neutrinos collide with electrons in the molecules of ice.
Although there are countless neutrinos in the

universe (fifty trillion neutrinos pass through your body

every second), actually aciccton Gat is a formidable
task. Netisnes carry no electrical charge, are practically

Passage |

LITERARY NARRATIVE: Passage A is adapted from the
essay “Touring Home” by Susan Power (©1996 by Susan
Power). Passage B is adapted from the memoir Beyond the
Narrow Gate: The Journey of Four Chinese Women from the
Middle Kingdom to Middle America by Leslie Chang (©1999
by Leslie Chang).

Passage A by Susan Power

My mother tells me stories every day: while she
cleans, while she cooks, on our way to the library,
standing in the checkout line at the supermarket. I like
to share her stories with other people and chatter away
when I am able to command adult attention.

a

“She left the reservation when she was sixteen
years old,” I tell my audience. Sixteen sounds very old
to me, but I always state the number because it seems
integral to my recitation. “She had never been on a train
before or used a telephone. She left Standing Rock to
take a job in Chicago so she could help out the family
during the War. She was so petrified of the new sur-
roundings, she stayed in her seat all the way from
McLaughlin, South Dakota, to Chicago, Illinois, and
didn’t move once.”

10

I usually laugh after saying this because I cannot
imagine my mother being afraid of anything. She is so
tall, a true Dakota woman; she rises against the sun like
a skyscraper, and when I draw her picture in my note-
book, she takes up the entire page. She talks politics
and attends sit-ins and says what’s on her mind.

20

I am her small shadow and witness. I am the timid
daughter who can rage only on paper.

We don’t have much money, but Mom takes me
from one end of the city to the other, on foot, on buses.

I will grow up believing that Chicago belongs to me,
because it was given to me by my mother.

“Yes, I think he was.” My mother takes my hand
and looks away from the painting I can see a sto
developing behind her eyes. and I tug on her arm to
release the words. She will tell me why Picasso was
blue, what his thoughts were as he painted this canvas,
She relates anecdotes I will never find in books, never
see footnoted in a biography of the master artist. I don’t
even bother to check these references because I like my
mother’s version best.

Passage B by Leslie Chang

Water belongs to everyone and to no one. For this
reason, I have always had a particular affinity for it,
which may strike some as mysterious. Westerners ask
me where my parents were born, as though the answer
will enable them to glean some knowledge. The answer
is Beijing and Luoyang. The truth is that this response
signifies nothing. The meaningful question would be to
ask where my ancestors lived. The answer to that is
inland. My father’s people came from Wuhan, birth-
place of the Chinese republic and the capital of Hubei,
that sweltering province sandwiched between Sichuan
and Anhui. My mother’s father was from Inner Mongo-
lia, land of desert and grassy plains.

Yet water calls to me. I remain convinced that I
would find peace if I could only have a house by the
ocean. I insisted on being married near the sea. This
bond, I know, comes from my mother.

She longs for a view more than anything else.
Once, staying at a hotel in San Francisco, she insisted
on seeing three different rooms before she found one
with which she was satisfied. It was on a floor so high
it made me dizzy, with a corner window overlooking
the bay. Even so, my mother spent most of her time 0”
the bridge linking the elevator bank to our wing. The
bridge consisted almost entirely of windows. It offered
a view in either direction that was brilliant and
blinding. If there had been a chair, she could have S#
forever, letting the gold sun and blue sea overwhelm het

My mother may have descended from inland
people, but they were also nomads. Her father on°®
rode his horse practically the length of China. from
Inner Mongolia to Guangzhou, a distance of s0™
75 twelve hundred miles. My mother could only becom *

mother to a: .

wwRhiceraclalndem

B. shadow and witness.

C. story behind someone’s eyes.
D. skyscraper against the sun.

ideas about Picasso and his work are accurate primar-
ily because the narrator:

A. doesn’t know which references would be best for
her to consult.

B. is confident that what her mother says about the
artist is accurate and feels that checking references
would be a waste of time. J .

C. doesn’t care whether her mother is accurate given

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from The Frozen-

Water Trade: A True Story by Gavin Weight
Gavin Weightman). iia

. When the first comprehensive report on the ice
industry of the United States was commissioned in
1879 as part of a national census, it was estimated that
about eight million tons were harvested annually,
though the business was so extensive and production so
poorly documented that this was, at best, a well-
informed guess. The figures were put together by one
Henry Hall, who signed himself “special agent” and
gave an account of the great growth of the industry in
10 the preceding ten years. Of the eight million tons of ice
harvested, about five million reached the consumer—
the rest melted during shipment and storage. By far the
biggest market was in New York, and none of its ice
was manufactured artificially: it was all cut in winter
15 and stored in hundreds of timber warehouses that lined
the lakes and rivers and had a capacity of up to fifty
thousand tons each. Between New York and Albany,
150 miles up the Hudson River, there were 135 ice-
houses, but even this was not enough to supply the
20 metropolis, which relied heavily on imports. In fact, in
the year of the great ice census, New York and Philadel-
phia suffered one of their recurrent ice “famines,” when
unseasonably warm weather destroyed the harvest on
the Hudson and local lakes, and the price of ice rose
25 from $4 to $5 a ton. That year the ice was fifteen to
twenty inches thick in Maine, a top-quality crop, and it
could be shipped down to New York at an estimated
cost of $1.50 a ton. This produced a frenzy of harvest-
ing on the Kennebec, Penobscot, and Sheepscot Rivers,
and two thousand cargoes of ice packed in hay and saw-
dust were shipped south to New York, Philadelphia, and
other more southern cities, where they were sold for a
total of around $1.5 million.

Though the demand for ice rose annually, the New
35 York suppliers did not explore the use of artificial
ae ia Instead, they began to buy up sections of
the Kennebec River shoreline and to erect great wooden
warehouses there, transforming the landscape of the
river for many miles. It was the same farther inland,
where ice companies bought up shoreline along the
lakes and put up storehouses to supply the meat indus-
try of Chicago and the brewers of Milwaukee, as well
as millions of domestic consumers.

The first real crisis in the natural-ice trade was
45 caused not by competition from artificial manufacture,
but by pollution, As the cities grew, they encroached on

rivers and lakes from which the ice was cut,

eer were health scares. This produced a search
for cleaner supplies away from towns, and stimulated

50 the search for a means of manufacturing ice With pure
water, The realization that the bacteria that cause qi,
eases h as typhoid were not killed off in frozen
water added to the urgency of finding safer forms of
refrigeration.

55 The natural-ice trade began to decline from the
early decades of the twentieth century, though in more
remote areas of North America where electric power
was not available but lake ice was abundant in winter, jt
survived as late as the 1950s. As ice harvesting died

60 out, the evidence of its former vast scale rapidly disap.

ared, There was no alternative use for the great ice-
jouses, many of which simply burned down, often seq
alight by a spark from a steam train—they were surpris-
ingly flammable, as most were made of wood and kept

65 as dry as possible to better preserve the blocks of ice
they housed. But the majority were demolished or
simply rotted away.

Over a wide area of the northern states, young

diving enthusiasts with no knowledge of the former ice

70 trade still emerge from lakes and rivers clutching an

impressive variety of odd implements—plows and chis-

els and scrapers that fell through the ice during the har-

vesting. One or two museums keep small displays of

these tools, and collectors have preserved manufactur-

75 ers’ catalogs that proudly present their versions of the

ice plow, the ice saw, the grapple, the Jack grapple, the

breaking-off bar, the caulk bar, the packing chisel,

the house bar, the fork bar, the float hook, the line

marker, and many other specialist implements the use
80 of which has long been forgotten.

The inner-city icehouses have also gone, and the
ice wagon and the iceman are rapidly fading memories.
All that is left in America of this once-great industry is
the water itself, which provided a continuously renew-

85 able supply of ice each winter. There are few memorials
on the banks of the rivers and lakes that once produced
such a vital crop,

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: This Passage is adapted from the article “Read
ly Lips” by Chiara Barzini (©2012 by the Harper’
Foundation. y the Harper's Magazine

In the passage, dubbing primarily refers to providing a film with
a new sound track. especially dialogue. in a different language.

Filmmakers have debated the respective merits of
subtitles and dubbing since the earliest sound films. In
“The Impossible Life of Clark Costa,” published in
1940 in the film journal Cinema, director Michelangelo

5 Antonioni wrote that Romolo Costa, the person who
dubbed all of actor Clark Gable’s performances, was a
“hybrid individual born out of a chemical combina-
tion.” This “half Clark, half Costa” was unbearable to
Antonioni, who considered dubbing to be a mere

10 “acoustic surrogate” of acting. To him, dubbing com-
Promised the intention of the director, leading to an
artificial product that lacked artistic unity. Director Pier
Paolo Pasolini, who called both dubbing and subtitles
“evils,” said that, between the two, dubbing was the less

15 harmful, since it allowed you to see the picture in full.
Director Jean Renoir called dubbing a “monstrosity, a
challenge to human and divine laws.”

Director Federico Fellini didn’t agree with any of

them. Dubbing was an extension of his shoots, a tech-

20 nique he would use to retouch and rewrite. He merci-

lessly dubbed over his actors, changing dialogue in

postproduction, sometimes having worked without a

script. (He reportedly instructed his actors to count

aloud in front of the camera so that he could insert new

25 dialogue afterward.) Renato Cortesi, a veteran Fellini

dubber, told me that, during the filming of Amarcord

(1973), he witnessed Fellini ask an old Neapolitan lady

to tell him a sad story. Over footage of this woman

recounting a tragic tale about her grandson, Fellini

30 added a new sound track about war and hunger

recorded by an actor from Emilia-Romagna, combining

the vivid expressiveness of the South with his favorite
northern accent.

If you visit a dubbing studio, the over-the-top zest

35 of the actors is evident in everything from their melo-
dramatic speech to their movements; standing in front
of the microphone, they coil and twitch. | asked Cortesi
whether this was a consequence of having to focus
one’s lifelong talent into the few centimeters between

40 mouth and microphone, a kind of bodily rebellion to the
condition of being heard but not seen, and he laughed.
“Of course it isn’t easy to spend a life in the darkness,
but this is hardly the reason why they twitch and turn!
Dubbers are used to reciting while trying to re-create

45 the bodily sensations of what they see on the screen
before them. If there is running in the film, they will
run on their feet. The moving,” he explained, “is the
result of re-creating large movements in small spaces.”

There are still few options for those seeking to

50 watch subtitled, original-language films at a movie
house in Italy. The Metropolitan cinema on Via del
Corso closed recently after a long battle involving intel-

65 been one of the few directors to break the habit of

In 2007, I met dubber Luca Ward, who provided
the voice of the narrator for a romantic comedy I co-
wrote, Scusa ma Ti Chiamo Amore (“Sorry but T Love

75 You”). What I didn’t then know was that everyone Ward
met wanted him to recite actor Samuel L. Jackson's
Ezekiel 25:17 passage from the film Pulp Fiction, and
that I should consider it an honor that he would offer a
performance to a stranger. When he finally did recite

80 the monologue, it was astonishing, every dramatic
pause carefully timed and every word perfectly enunci-
ated. I understood that, if anybody took Samuel L.
Jackson away from Ward, it would have meant taking
away a part of his soul; he was, as Antonioni would say,

85 half Ward, half Jackson. Leaving the day’s recording
session, Ward told me he was off to have dinner with
actress Meg Ryan, before raising an eyebrow and clari-
fying, “With Meg Ryan’s dubber ... 1 am having
dinner with Meg Ryan’s voice.”

21. The last sentence of the passage primarily serves to
illustrate the passage author's central claim that:

A. a dubber wants others in the film industry to
respect the actor he or she usually dubs.

B. the work of Ryan's dubber is as effective as that of
Jackson's dubber.

C. a dubber begins to seem almost like a hybrid of
him- or herself and the actor he or she dubs.

D. Ward is unlike most dubbers in that he prefers (0

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the essay

“Making Stuff: From Bacon to Bakelite” by 1 (2
erent Balt: it y Philip Ball (©2010

During the Industrial Revolution, the high price of
steel meant that many large engineering projects were
carried out that used instead cast iron, which is brittle
and prone to failure. This was why Henry Bessemer's

5 new process for making steel was greeted with jubila-
tion: the details, announced at a meeting of the Bri
Association in 1856, were published in full in The
Times. Bessemer himself was lauded not just an
engineer but as a scientist, being elected a Fellow of the

10 Royal Society in 1879,

Bessemer’s process controlled the amount of
carbon mixed with iron to make steel. That the propor-
tion of carbon governs the hardness was first noted in
1774 by the Swedish metallurgist Torbern Bergmann,

15 who was by any standards a scientist, teaching chem-
istry, physics and mathematics at Uppsala. Bergmann
made an extensive study of the propensity of different
chemical elements to combine with one another—a
property known as elective affinity, central to the

20 eighteenth-century notion of chemical reactivity. He
was a mentor and sponsor of Carl Wilhelm Scheele, the
greatest Swedish chemist of the age and co-discoverer
of oxygen.

Oxygen, as a component of air, was the key to the
25 Bessemer process. It offered a way of removing impuri-
ties from pig iron and adjusting its carbon content
during conversion to steel. A blast of air through the
molten metal turned impurities such as silicon into light
silica slag (a collection of compounds removed from
30 metal in the smelting process), and removed carbon in
the form of volatile carbon dioxide. Pig iron contains as
much as 4 per cent carbon; steels have only around
0.3-2 per cent. Meanwhile, the heat produced in these
reactions with oxygen kept the iron molten without the

35 need for extra fuel.

It was long known that steel can be improved with

a spice of other elements. A dash of the metal man-

ganese helps to remove oxygen and sulphur from the

iron, and most of the manganese currently produced

40 globally is used for this purpose. Manganese also

makes steel stronger, while nickel and chromium

improve its hardness. And chromium is the key additive

in stainless steel—in a proportion of more than about

11 per cent, it makes the metal rust-resistant, Most

45 modern steels are therefore alloys blended to give the
desired properties.

But is this science? Some of the early innovations
in steel alloys were chance discoveries, often due to
impurities incorporated by accident. In this respect,

50 metallurgy has long retained the air of an artisan craft,
akin to the trial-and-error explorations of dyers, glass
makers and potters. But the reason for this empiricism
is not that the science of metallurgy is trivial; it
is because it is so difficult, According to Rodney

The mechanical properties of metals depend on
how flaws in the crystal structure, called defects, move
and interact, These defects are produced by almost
inevitable imperfections in the regular stacking of
atoms in the crystalline material. The most common
type of stacking fault is called a dislocation: Metals
bend, rather than shattering like porcelain, because dis-
locations can shift around and accommodate the defor-
mation. But if dislocations accumulate and get
entangled, restricting their ability to move, the metal
becomes brittle. This is what happens after repeated
deformation, causing the cracking known as metal
fatigue. Dislocations can also get ‘apped at the bound-
aries between the fine, microscopic grains that divide a
metal into mosaics of crystallites. The arrest of disloca-
tions at grain edges means that metals may be made
harder by reducing the size of their grains, a useful
trick for modifying their mechanical behaviour.

Passage |

The termite Reticulitermes flavipes consumes wood
and bark. A study examined whether the consumption of
wood or bark mulch by R. flavipes varies with the type of
mulch or the age of the mulch. Separate portions of each
of 5 types of mulch were aged (allowed to decay) for 1, 24,
and 48 weeks. Then, 2 g of each type of 1-week-old mulch
were put into a box, 2 g of each type of 24-week-old mulch
were put into a second box. and 2g of each type of
48-week-old mulch were put into a third box. Next, 1 g of
R. flavipes was added to each box. After 15 days, the mass
of mulch consumed, in milligrams (mg), was determined
for each type and age of mulch (see figure).

Samples of Species C bacteria must often be trans-
Ported from the areas in which they are collected. During
transport, the samples are typically packed in ice to keep
them alive. However, ice is not always available where the
samples are collected.

Scientists studied how lyophilization (a freeze-drying
process that doesn’t require ice) followed by incubation
affects the survival of 2 strains (Strain E and Strain V2) of
Species C bacteria,

Experiment 1

The scientists placed a 100 #L (1 pL = 10° mL)
sample of a nutrient medium containing 4 = 10° Strain E
elementary bodies into each of 8 sterile test tubes. An ele-
mentary body is the infective form of Species C. The
sample in each of the tubes was then lyophilized, and each
tube was sealed. Two of the tubes were incubated at 4°C, 2
were incubated at 20°C, 2 were incubated at 30°C, and 2
were incubated at 37°C.

One week after the start of incubation, the percent
survival (the percent of the elementary bodies that sur-
vived) was determined for the sample in | of the 2 tubes at
each temperature. Then, | month after the start of incuba-
tion, the it survival was determined for the sample in

the remaining tube at each temperature. The results are
shown in Table 1.

Passage Ill

When an object is submerged in a fluid, the object dis-
places a volume of fluid equal to the object's submerged
volume. The fluid exerts an upward buoyant force on the
object that is equal in magnitude to the weight of the dis-
placed fluid. The object floats if the buoyant force equals
the object’s weight.

A group of students conducted 2 studies on buoyant
forces using 3 fluids—water, Fluid A, and Fluid B—
having densities of 1.0 g/cm’, 1.25 g/cm’, and 1.50 g/em',
respectively.

Study 1

The students placed a 10cm long cylinder in a con-
tainer of water and measured the length of the portion of
the cylinder that was submerged. They then repeated this
procedure with a container of Fluid A and a container of
Fluid B (see Figure 1).

Fluid A

Figure |

Study 2

The students placed a stone—either Stone X, Stone Y,
or Stone Z—in a net that was tied to a spring balance. They
recorded the force measured by the balance as the stone’s
weight, W. They then submerged the stone in water and
again recorded the force measured by the balance (see

Figure 2).

42

Figure 2

The students calculated the buoyant force on the stone in
water as W minus the force that was measured when the
stone was submerged. They repeated this procedure to test
all 3 stones in all 3 fluids. Table 1 lists each stone's
volume, in cm*, and W, in newtons (N), as well as the
buoyant force, in N, on each stone in the fluid.

Passage IV

Chemical reactions that release heat are exothermic
reactions, The amount of heat released depends on the
number of moles of reactants consumed in the reaction, A
mole of any substance is 6 * 10°' molecules or formula
units of the substance.

When sodium hypochlorite (NaCIO) and sodium
iodide (Nal) are dissolved in acidic H;0, an exothermic
reaction occurs:

NaClO + Nal — products + heat

Students did an experiment to study this reaction.

Experiment
In each of 8 trials, the students performed Steps 1-5:

1. A known volume of a 0.2 mole/L aqueous NaCIO solu-
tion was poured into a foam coffee cup. A lid was
placed on the cup.

2. A thermometer was placed into the solution throu ha
hole in the lid. The solution's initial temperature, 7, of
22.0°C was recorded.

3, The lid was lifted, and a known volume of a 0.2 mole/L
aqueous Nal solution, also at a T, of 22.0°C, was poured
into the cup. The lid was put back on the cup, and the
solution was swirled.

4. The solution’s final (maximum) temperature, T;, was
measured.

5. The change in temperature, AT, was calculated:
AT=T-T

The data for each trial are shown in Table 1.

When viewed from Earth, the other planets in the
solar system usually appear to move prograde (eastward
relative to the stars). Occasionally, however, each planet
appears to briefly move retrograde (westward relative to
the stars). For example, Figure 1 shows Mars’s position rel-

Figure |

Two hypotheses were proposed to explain why the
planets occasionally appear to move retrograde.

Hypothesis 1

Earth is the solar system’s central body, and the other
bodies move around Earth in looped orbits. Each body
(except Earth) has 2 circles associated with it: a deferent
and an epicycle. Both circles rotate counterclockwise, and
their combined motions result in a body following a looped
orbit. In Figure 2, the left panel shows Mars’s deferent and
epicycle, and the right panel shows Mars’s orbit.

Figure 2

48

As a body passes through @ loop, the body's motion
changes from prograde to retrograde and back. The larger a
body's deferent, the more loops in the body's orbit, and the

more often that body passes through a loop.

Hypothesis 2

The Sun is the solar
planets move countercloc
orbits. The larger a planet's
takes to complete a revolution " ;
the line of sight from Earth to a aa planet drifts over
time. Figure 3 shows the orbits of Earth and Mars, and the
‘ions of Earth and Mars, on each of the 4 dates labeled
in Figure 1, For each date, the line of sight from Earth to
Mars is projected onto a view of the sky.

ystem’s central body, and the
se around the Sun in elliptical
orbit, the more time the planet
around the Sun. As a result,

There are 2 rules for apparent retrograde motion:

¢ A planet with an orbit larger than Earth's appears to
move retrograde whenever Earth passes between the Sun
and that planet. The larger that planet's orbit, the more
often a pass occurs.

© A planet with an orbit smaller than Earth’s appems to
move retrograde whenever that planet passes between
the Sun and Earth. The smaller that planet's orbit, the
more often a pass occurs.

s. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
ead across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that Corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your Scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided

the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half: round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
