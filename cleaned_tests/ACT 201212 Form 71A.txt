During the Great Depression, Robert Porterfield, a

young actor from southwestern Virginia, was among the

series of actors in New York City who were unemployed.

Porterfield was also familiar with the plight of farmers

back home and many farmers had livestock and produce

Porterfield also convinced playwrights to take
food in lieu of their usual cash royalties. For example,
Tenowned writers such as Tennessee Williams, Rachel
Crothers, and Clare Boothe Luce received payment in
Virginia hams. George Bernard Shaw, a vegetarian,

accepted his royalties in spinach. By the end of their

first season, Porterfield’s actors had managed to earn

featuring both established and emerging writers. [6] West

had decided that including a few well-known authors,
such as Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps, would

attract more readers. [7] As planned, though, the

issue really flashed its lights on unknown writers,
many of rer gnchiding the Reverend Dr. Pauli Murray,
the feminist and poet, would become famous participants
in the civil rights movement. [53]

West had planned for the journal to run quarterly.

was unable to acquire the well-crafted writing she
sought from young writers. West came to rely on

From 1934 to 1937, Challenge appeared only

West relaunched it under a different name with a new

Passage |

PROSE FICTION:
Mozart Season by Virg
Euwer Wolff)

This passage is adapted from the novel The
nia Euwer Wolff (©1991 by Virginia

The hair on a violin bow is the part of the bow, traditionally
made of horsehair, that makes contact with the strings when
the violin is played.

Now that you’re warmed up, let’s revisit Mr.
Mozart,” said Mr. Kaplan.

It was a gorgeous June morning and in my mind I

heard another voice: “Now that you're warmed up, let’s

5 demolish those Vikings.” My softball coach and my
violin teacher were overlapping each other.

With my softball coach, it was stairsteps and laps
and endless batting practice. With Mr. Kaplan it was
eight repetitions of very fast B-major scales and five

10 minutes of octaves. Two weeks after being the shortstop
on the team that had lost in the second round of the dis-
trict play-offs, | was at my lesson, looking for the
Mozart concerto.

In the summer I get to have morning lessons twice
15 a week, and I love it. I work best in the mornings.
Things haven't had time to get so cluttered yet.

4 I put the music on the stand and got ready. With
f Mr, Kaplan you don’t whine or mutter. It doesn’t help.
“We want right notes, not excuses” is what all music
a 20 teachers say, I guess. He doesn’t have to say it very

many times; you learn it fast. Mr. Kaplan and I'd been
together for seven years, and he was going to know the
instant I got to the top of the second page that I hadn't
been practicing the Mozart. At that spot there’s a fast
shift from first finger to fourth finger on the G string,
and you have to get ready for it. You can’t let a shift
like that take you by surprise.

“Straight through. Right, Allegra? Including
@adenzas.” A cadenza is the part where the violin plays
alone, it’s harder than the rest of the piece, and it gets
audience all excited when you do it in a concert.

The introduction is forty-one migasures long This
time, instead of playing just the last ee ree it
on the piano, Mr. Kaplan played the as hing ie
wears half-glasses, and he has a balding nead with
some blondish-gray hair on the back, and a most Y gray
short beard, and he’s a little bit slumped over when he

the piano. His ears stick out in a funny way, |
the way he looks. The introduction to the first
movement, the part the orchestra would play, mostly
announces what the solo violin will play when it
begins. That way you get to listen to it twice

While he was doing it, I practiced the G-string
shift without making any noise, sliding my hand up and
down the fingerboard.

I love this concerto. Mozart only wrote five of
them for the violin. The year before, Mr. Kaplan had let
me choose which one to learn, the third one or this one,
and I'd taken them both home and spun my bow the
way you spin a tennis racquet. If it landed with the hair
toward me, I’d learn the third, in G; and if it landed
with the hair away from me, I’d learn this one. When
Mr. Kaplan and my parents found out I'd treated my
bow With Such Astonishing Disrespect, they got very
alarmed about it.

__ __ P'd worked very hard on it for several months, and
in February, we'd made a tape of it to send to a contest.
Id worried and fretted and trembled, but we'd gotten
the tape made. After that, I'd sort of neglected it. In
softball season I'd practically stopped being a violinist.

Mr. Kaplan, who was having fun playing the intro-
duction, got to the BUM: punspa-siche eee ae comes
right before the violin begins. I was ready. It starts on 4

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“The Little Foxes” by Adele Conover (©2001 by Smithsonian
Magazine)

Champagne-blond in the failing light, seven tiny
animals engage in what looks like a game of touch foot-
ball. Their big-eared parents, five-pound San Joaquin
kit foxes, mark the playground’s boundaries with an

§ occasional sharp woof. I could be anywhere in the
8.5-million-acre San Joaquin Valley a century or so
ago.

Reality intervenes. I am standing in a nondescript

field, and that dark “cliff” in the background is an

40 insurance company. I am in Bakersfield, Californi

early April. This family of 9, along with 200 or so

fellow San Joaquin kit foxes, shares this town with

some 250,000 humans. Biologist Brian Cypher, who

studies this unique urban subtribe for the San Joaquin

15 Valley Endangered Species Recovery Program, notes

that the human population is growing by 3,000 to 5,000
annually.

Although Cypher’s tribe is safe for the moment, in

order to ensure its long-term survival, he seeks the

20 secret to its success. His data is being matched by the

research of Katherine Ralls, a scientist with the Smith-

sonian’s Conservation and Research Center, on a wilder

kit fox population living just west of here, in the

Carrizo Plain National Monument. The combined infor-

25 mation will reveal much about genetics, behavior,

distribution and population size that can be applied to

the little carnivore’s conservation. One of several sub-

species of kit fox, and the only one that is listed feder-

i, ally as endangered, the San Joaquin kit fox is

og 30 considered an umbrella species for this part of Califor-

nia: if it survives, then other threatened and endangered
animals and plants that share its habitat will too.

Scientists estimate that the range-wide population

of the San Joaquin kit fox prior to 1930 was 8,000 to
$5 12,000; in 1975, about 7,000. The current population is
unknown. Three “core” and several satellite popula-

. tions exist in California, but they are widely separated.

The San Joaquin kit fox came to such dire straits—
less than 5 percent of its original habitat remains—as a
40 result of the usual suspects: agriculture, development,
oil exploration and, more so in earlier days, “varmint
control” poisoning and trapping.

In Bakersfield, says Cypher, the attitude toward
it foxes is mixed. “Some are afraid of them. Some
bt would like to shoot them, Some regard them
‘their’ kit foxes, and if they see us trapping to put on
tags and change [radio collar] batteries, they want

two speeds, fast and faster, and sometimes they can
avoid trouble with urban predators by squeezing into
openings no larger than four inches across. The little
foxes dig make-do dens under storage areas, and in
school yards, storm-water drainage sumps, concrete

rubble piles and pipes.

“Their urban life is a bonus,” says Cypher,
“Storm-water storage sumps are proving to be good
habitat, and every time a new housing division comes
along, builders have to put in a new sump—so unknow-
ingly, developers are actually creating kit fox habitat.”

For the most part, in the “real” world kit foxes
escape their predators and the high temperatures of
their desert environment by spending the day under-
ground in a den. In Bakersfield, they follow suit. Kit
foxes move every couple of weeks to a new den.
Moving to different dens may be one reason why they
have persisted—the constantly changing abodes pro-
vide new places to hide.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “Por
trait of the Artist as an Immigrant: Ha Jin's Quintessentially
American Novel” by Ruth Franklin (©2007 by Wash
t. Newsweek Interactive Co. LLC)

Chines

ington P

It is a literary truism that writers ought to write in
their native language. Ezra Pound, Paul Celan, Thomas
Mann, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Czeslaw Milosz: They all
spent much of their lives far from their homelands, but

5 their work is inconceivable in any language other than
its original. With few exceptions, writers who break
this mold are met with incredulity. Creativity, so the
mythology goes, can spring only from an original
source

10 The work of Ha Jin, who has lived in the United
States for more than 20 years and now teaches creative
writing at Boston University, has been greeted with
similar wonderment. With the publication of A Free
Life. his fifth novel (there have also been three books of

15 poetry and two of short stories), he is still fielding the
perennial question: Why does he choose to write in

inglish?

A Free Life—Jin’s most personal novel, though not
exactly autobiographical—confronts the taboo head on.
20 This meandering yet deeply affecting novel is at once a
version of the classic saga of an immigrant family
adjusting to life in the United States and a highly
unconventional portrait of the artist as an immigrant,
family man, and all-around ordinary guy. While Jin has
25 always been polite to his interviewers, it seems quite
clear that Nan Wu, the poet who is the protagonist of A
Free Life, speaks for his creator in response to a maga-
zine editor who asks, “Can you imagine your work
becoming part of our language?” Nan bristles: “I have
30 no answer to that xenophobic question, which ignores
the fact that the vitality of English has partly resulted
from its ability to assimilate all kinds of alien
energies.”

In a relaxed narrative, A Free Life follows Nan
35 over the course of a double journey: his quest to pro-
vide his family with financial stability while simultane-
ously realizing his dream of becoming a poet. He starts
off working odd jobs, but soon he and his wife,
Pingping, have saved up enough money to buy a Chi-
40 nese restaurant and a house of their own. By all the
benchmarks of the American dream, they are success-
ful. But Nan worries that the banality of his daily exis-
tence is stifling him as a writer. “Do you have to live a
literary life to produce literary work?” he asks a poet
friend. By closely tracking every step of Nan’s creative
sis, Jin’s novel offers an alternative vision of imag-
itive growth inspired precisely by the most mundane
ircumstances.

Ha Jin has said that he sees himself as a Chinese-
lerican writer: “I need the hyphen.” A Free Life is
he quintessential Chinese-American book, in which the
lemma of how to exist simultaneously in two
Yorlds—on both sides of that hyphen—animates every

75 Somewhat less convincing is Jin’s other major

stylistic choice. While his other works have been rigor.

episodes that lead down dead ends and digressions that
amount to little. The Wus’ life is full of dramatic

80 events, but they are presented in a tone of almost comi-
cal understatement. This artlessness feels intentional, |
an approximation of how a talented but unschooled
writer like Nan might tell his own story

It is a testimony to Jin’s abilities that the novel

85 manages to be engrossing despite its total disregard for

narrative tension. The charm of A Free Life comes from

its cheerful subversiveness, its gentle upending of the
most persistent myths about the creation of art.

NATURAL SCIENCE: Thi:

Geographic Society). i : ea

Mangroves live life on the edge. With one foot on
land and one in the sea, these botanical amphibians
Occupy a zone of desiccating heat, choking mud, and
Salt levels that would kill an ordinary plant within

§ hours. Yet the forests mangroves form are among the
most productive and biologically complex ecosystems
on Earth. Birds roost in the canopy, shellfish attach
themselves to the roots, and snakes and crocodiles
come to hunt. Mangroves provide nursery grounds for

10 fish; a food source for monkeys, deer, iree-climbing
crabs, even kangaroos; and a nectar source for bats and
honeybees.

As a group, mangroves can’t be defined too
closely. There are some 70 species from two dozen
15 families—among them palm, hibiscus, holly, plumbago,
and legumes. They range from prostrate shrubs to
200-foot-high timber trees. Though most prolific in
Southeast Asia, where they are thought to have origi-
nated, mangroves circle the globe. Most live within
20 30 degrees of the Equator, but a few hardy types have
adapted to temperate climates, and one lives as far from
the tropical sun as New Zealand. Wherever they live,
they share one thing in common: They’re brilliant
adapters. Each mangrove has an ultrafiltration system
25 to keep much of the salt out and a complex root system
that allows it to survive in the intertidal zone. Some
have snorkel-like roots called pneumatophores that
Stick out of the mud to help them take in air; others use
prop roots or buttresses to keep their trunks upright in

These plants are also landbuilders par excellence.
The plants’ interlocking roots stop riverborne sedi-
ments from coursing out to sea, and their trunks and
branches serve as a palisade that diminishes the erosive

Bangladesh has not lost sight of that logic, putting

a great premium on the ability of mangroves to stabilize
1ores and trap sediments. A low-lying country with a
long, vulnerable coastline, Bangladesh is also land
starved, with a population density of 2,500 persons per

square mile. By planting mangroves on delta sediments

washed down from the Himalaya, it has gained over
300,000 acres of new land on the Bay of Bengal. The
ngs “are relatively new, but there have been
sroves here for as long as the Ganges, Brahmapu-
d Meghna Rivers have been draining into the bay.

ing the carbon budget

By measuring photosynthesis, sap flow, and other
processes in the leaves of the forest canopy, Ong and
his team can tell how much carbon 1S eS into
mangrove leaves, how much is stored in living trees,
and how much eventually makes its way into nearb
waterways. The measurements suggest that mangroves
may have the highest net processing of carbon of an;
natural ecosystem (about a hundred pounds per acre per
day) and that as much as a third of this may be exported
in the form of organic compounds to mudflats. Man.
groves, it seems, are carbon factories, and their demolj-
tion robs the marine environment of a vital element,

Ong’s team has also shown that a significant
portion of the carbon ends up in forest sediments,
remaining sequestered there for thousands of years,
Conversion of a mangrove forest to a shrimp pond
changes a carbon sink into a carbon source, liberating
the accumulated carbon back into the atmosphere—but
50 times faster than it was sequestered.

If mangroves were to become recognized as
carbon-storage assets, that could radically alter the way
these forests are valued, says Ong.

“Take Indonesia, which has the largest total area
of mangroves of any country in the world. It can’t
afford to save them for nothing,” Ong says. “But if the
Indonesians could trade the carbon-storage potential of
their mangroves as a commodity, that would create 4
great incentive to stop bulldozing them for shrimp
ponds or chipping them for the production of rayon.”

Passage IV

A researcher investigated the growth of 6 species of
floodplain plants. Each species was classified as either
flood-sensitive (S) or flood-tolerant (T) (see Table 1).

Table 1

Achillea ptarmica As T |
Achillea millefolium | Am s

Experiment

Seeds from each of the 6 species were germinated in a
growth chamber maintained at 25.5°C during the day and
at 10°C at night.

After germination, the seedlings of each species were
planted in separate 0.5 L pots and grown for 4 weeks. The
seedlings were watered 3 times per week.

At the end of the 4 weeks, each plant was repotted
into its own 4 L pot containing a substrate composed of a
4:1 mixture, by mass, of sand to compost. The plants were
grown for 2 more weeks: during this time, they were
watered 3 times per week.

Next, the potted plants were placed in plastic tubs
such that each tub contained 8 plants of each species. Each
tub of plants was subjected to a different treatment (see
Table 2) for 3 weeks.

Student 1

Mineral oil is made up of very large molecules, while
H,O is made up of very small molecules. Thus, the spaces
between mineral oil molecules are much larger than the
spaces between H,O molecules (see figure).

Based on Student 1’s explanation, is it likely that solid
H,O would be soluble in mineral oil?

F. Yes, because the solute molecules and the Solvent
molecules are nonpolar.

G. Yes, because H,O molecules are much smaller
than mineral oil molecules.

H. No, because the solute molecules are polar and the
solvent molecules are nonpolar.

J. No, because H,O molecules are much larger than

A. Todine < H,O < mineral oil

Educators debate whether high school students should be

allowed to listen to audio recordings of literary works instead

of reading assigned works of literature. Some educators support

allowing students to listen to audio recordings of literature

instead of reading assigned works because they think audio

books, like theatrical productions, offer a way to increase
students’ interest in literature by bringing stories and literary
characters to life. Other educators do not support allowing
students to listen to audio recordings of literature instead of
reading assigned works because they think that, in order to be
best prepared for college or the workplace, students need to
take every opportunity to work on improving their reading
skills. In your opinion, should high school students be allowed
to listen to audio recordings of literary works instead of reading
assigned works of literature?

In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write
about either one of the two points of view given, or you may
present a different point of view on this question. Use specific
reasons and examples to support your position. =

acore. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,

scale score that corresponds to that raw » As you
determine your seale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test Is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1
Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4, If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number, (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1
