This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On
the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered
to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are
lettered to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the
oval in that row lettered the same as your answer.
Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil
and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink
or a mechanical pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark
thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each
question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals
with the same number as the question.

www.crackab.com

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only
on the number of questions you answer correctly during
the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized
for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing
staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is
called for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a test on which time has
already been called, and you may not go ahead to
another test. To do so will disqualify you from the
examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called
at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill
in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

Nevertheless, I eked out my first news story,

half a page, but I handed it to my grandmother with pride.
After she read it, she squinted at me from behind her

brushing dirt from her jeans. The seat of the nearest swing
dangled from one chain while the other chain swayed back

13. The essay writer is considering deleting the underlined
portion. Should the underlined portion be kept or
deleted?

Kept, because it introduces the grandmother’s
voice to the narrative.

Kept, because it reiterates the main theme of the
narrative.

Deleted, because it fails to explain how the grand-
mother is qualified to give the narrator advice.
Deleted, because it takes the focus away from the
narrator’s writing technique.

Questions 14 and 15 ask about the preceding passage as a whole.

14, The essay writer is considering adding the following

sentence to the essay:
“This is a good start, Anthony,” she said.

15. Suppose the essay writer’s primary purpose had been
to provide a brief overview of the narrator’s fifteen-

A.

Yes, because it describes the narrator’s most sig-
nificant news stories and how they shaped him as a
writer.

Yes, because it focuses on the news stories the nar-
rator wrote when he was nine years old.

No, because it instead focuses on the narrator’s
grandmother’s experiences as a news writer and
how those experiences shaped her career.

No, because it instead describes a single story that
marked the beginning of the narrator’s interest in
news writing.

Animals Over, Under, and Above All

In northwest Montana, more than thirty species of
animals, ranging from otters to elk, travel across a busy
fifty-six-mile stretch of US Highway 93 via overpasses,
bridges, and tunnels. These structures comprise the most

expensive and innovative wildlife-centered highway design

project in the United States. [A]

PASSAGE III
Eva Zeisel’s Playful Search for Beauty
O]

Speaking at an event held to honor her nearly
eighty years as a ceramics designer, artist Eva Zeisel
said her focus had always been the same; a playful
search for beauty. [A] The Hungarian-born artist’s
search began following a 1925 trip to the World’s
Fair in Paris, France. [B] There she had visited
row after row of exhibitions not only by
the world’s preeminent new architects but
also by creators of fashion mannequins.

Zeisel felt that many of the featured

designs, stressing stark, geometric shapes

and angular lines, fundamentally

too cold. [34] For Zeisel, the only

emotion they conveyed was “leave me alone.”

that items to be used in the home, where people

gather most often and most closely, should be warm
and inviting. Working in simple white ceramic,

Its mildly sweet

tang is often compared to that of a cranberry. But within
this small fruit lays miraculin, a natural protein with the
power to trick the tongue by making even the sourest
flavors taste remarkably sweet.

Eating a miracle fruit allows miraculin
molecules that bind to the sweetness receptors
on the tongue’s taste buds. Then, when a food
containing acid (which generally causes a sour taste)
is consumed, this molecular bond intensifies. This
reaction, in turn, transmits a signal indicating sweetness

to the brain. Thus, acidic foods with sour or bitter flavors.

Founded in 1964 as an endeavor to

Thompson and Na‘ope believed all elements of hula
tradition, both ancient (referring to hula predating 1893)
and modern, need to be preserved and shared. [D] Kahiko,

or ancient hula, involves chanting and little instrumental

accompaniment. ‘Avana (modern hula), on the other hand,

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
short story “Janus” by Ann Beattie (©1985 by The New Yorker
Magazine, Inc.).

The bowl was perfect. Perhaps it was not what
you'd select if you faced a shelf of bowls, and not the
sort of thing that would inevitably attract a lot of atten-
tion at a crafts fair, yet it had real presence. It was as
predictably admired as a mutt who has no reason to sus-
pect he might be funny. Just such a dog, in fact, was
often brought out (and in) along with the bowl.

Andrea was a real-estate agent, and when she
thought that some prospective buyers might be dog-
lovers, she would drop off her dog at the same time she
placed the bowl in the house that was up for sale. She
would put a dish of water in the kitchen for Mondo,
take his squeaking plastic frog out of her purse and
drop it on the floor. He would pounce delightedly, just
as he did every day at home, batting around his favorite
toy. The bowl usually sat on a coffee table, though
recently she had displayed it on top of a pine blanket
chest and on a lacquered table. It was once placed on a
cherry table beneath a glorious still-life painting, where
it held its own.

Everyone who has purchased a house or who has
wanted to sell a house must be familiar with some of
the tricks used to convince a buyer that the house is
quite special: a fire in the fireplace in early evening;
jonquils in a pitcher on the kitchen counter, where no
one ordinarily has space to put flowers; perhaps the
slight aroma of spring, made by a single drop of scent
vaporizing from a lamp bulb.

The wonderful thing about the bowl, Andrea
thought, was that it was both subtle and noticeable—a
paradox of a bowl. Its glaze was the color of cream and
seemed to glow no matter what light it was placed in.
There were a few bits of color in it—tiny geometric
flashes—and some of these were tinged with flecks of
silver. They were as mysterious as cells seen under a
microscope; it was difficult not to study them, because
they shimmered, flashing for a split second, and then
resumed their shape. Something about the colors and
their random placement suggested motion. People who
liked country furniture always commented on the bowl,

&

but then it turned out that people who felt comfortable
with opulence loved it just as much. But the bowl was
not at all ostentatious, or even so noticeable that anyone
would suspect that it had been put in place deliberately.
They might notice the height of the ceiling on first
entering a room, and only when their eye moved down
from that, or away from the refraction of sunlight on a
pale wall, would they see the bowl. Then they would go
immediately to it and comment. Yet they always fal-
tered when they tried to say something. Perhaps it was
because they were in the house for a serious reason, not
to notice some object.

Once, Andrea got a call from a woman who had
not put in an offer on a house she had shown her. That
bowl, she said—would it be possible to find out where
the owners had bought that beautiful bowl? Andrea pre-
tended that she did not know what the woman was
referring to. A bowl, somewhere in the house? Oh, on a
table under the window. Yes, she would ask, of course.
She let a couple of days pass, then called back to say
that the bowl had been a present and the people did not
know where it had been purchased.

She was sure that the bowl brought her luck. Bids
were often put in on houses where she had displayed
the bowl. Sometimes the owners, who were always
asked to be away or to step outside when the house was
being shown, didn’t even know that the bowl had been
in their house. Once—she could not imagine how—she
left it behind, and then she was so afraid that something
might have happened to it that she rushed back to the
house and sighed with relief when the owner opened
the door. The bowl, Andrea explained—she had pur-
chased a bowl and set it on the chest for safekeeping
while she toured the house with the prospective buyers,
and she . . . She felt like rushing past the frowning
woman and seizing her bowl. The owner stepped aside.
In the few seconds before Andrea picked up the bowl,
she realized that the owner must have just seen that it
had been perfectly placed, that the sunlight struck the
bluer part of it. Her pitcher had been moved to the far
side of the chest, and the bowl predominated. All the
way home, Andrea wondered how she could have left
the bowl behind. It was like leaving a friend at an
outing—just walking off. Sometimes there were stories
in the paper about families forgetting a child some-
where and driving to the next city. Andrea had only
gone a mile down the road before she remembered.

Originally cultivated in the Ottoman Empire, tulips were intro- base color that is always yellow or white and a second,

duced to Europe at the end of the sixteenth century and

. laid-on color called an anthocyanin; the mix of these
became wildly popular in the seventeenth century.

60 two hues determines the unitary color we see. The virus
works by partially and irregularly suppressing the
anthocyanin, thereby allowing a portion of the under-
lying color to show through. It wasn’t until the 1920s,
after the invention of the electron microscope, that sci-

65 entists discovered the virus was being spread from tulip
to tulip by Myzus persicae, the peach potato aphid.
Peach trees were a common feature of seventeenth-
century gardens.

One crucial element of the beauty of the tulip that
intoxicated the Dutch, the Turks, the French, and the
English has been lost to us. To them the tulip was a
magic flower because it was prone to spontaneous and
brilliant eruptions of color. In a planting of a hundred
tulips, one of them might be so possessed, opening to
reveal the white or yellow ground of its petals painted,
as if by the finest brush and steadiest hand, with intri-
cate feathers or flames of a vividly contrasting hue.
10 When this happened, the tulip was said to have
“broken,” and if a tulip broke in a particularly striking
manner—if the flames of the applied color reached
clear to the petal’s lip, say, and its pigment was brilliant
and pure and its pattern symmetrical—the owner of that
bulb had won the lottery. For the offsets of that bulb
would inherit its pattern and hues and command a fan-
tastic price. The fact that broken tulips for some
unknown reason produced fewer and smaller offsets
than ordinary tulips drove their prices still higher.
20 Semper Augustus was the most famous such break.

a

By the 1920s the Dutch regarded their tulips as

70 commodities to trade rather than jewels to display, and

since the virus weakened the bulbs it infected (the

reason the offsets of broken tulips were so small and

few in number), Dutch growers set about ridding their

fields of the infection. Color breaks, when they did

75 occur, were promptly destroyed, and a certain peculiar

manifestation of natural beauty abruptly lost its claim
on human affection.

a

I can’t help thinking that the virus was supplying
something the tulip needed, just the touch of abandon
80 the flower’s chilly formality called for. Maybe that’s
why the broken tulip became such a treasure in
seventeenth-century Holland: the wayward color loosed
on a tulip by a good break perfected the flower, even as
the virus responsible set about destroying it.

The closest we have to a broken tulip today is the
group known as the Rembrandts—so named because
Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of
his time. But these latter-day tulips, with their heavy
patterning of one or more contrasting colors, look
clumsy by comparison, as if painted in haste with a
thick brush. To judge from the paintings we have of the
originals, the petals of broken tulips could be as fine
and intricate as marbleized papers, the extravagant
30 swirls of color somehow managing to seem both bold

tulips was harmful to bulbs.

B. argues that growers should have dealt with broken
tulips differently.

C. challenges the idea that broken tulips were
beautiful.

D. presents a personal meditation on broken tulips.

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: Passage A is from the book Foundation:
B-Boys, B-Girls, and Hip-Hop Culture in New York by
Joseph G. Schloss. Passage B is from the book The Tanning of
America: How Hip-Hop Created a Culture That Rewrote the
Rules of the New Economy by Steve Stoute.

Passage A by Joseph G. Schloss
The term b-boying refers to break dancing.

In the first sense of the term, hip-hop refers collec-
tively to a group of related art forms in different media
(visual, sound, movement) that were practiced in Afro-
Caribbean, African American, and Latino neighbor-
hoods in New York City in the 1970s. The term, when
used in this sense, also refers to the events at which
these forms were practiced, the people who practiced
them, their shared aesthetic sensibility, and contempo-
rary activities that maintain those traditions.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this variety
of hip-hop is that it is unmediated, in the sense that
most of the practices associated with it are both taught
and performed in the context of face-to-face interac-
tions between human beings. To some degree, this con-
stitutes an intentional rejection of the mass media by its
practitioners, but to a great extent it is just the natural
result of the practices themselves. Activities like
b-boying and graffiti writing are simply not well suited
to the mass media. Although in both cases, brief
attempts were made to bring these forms of expression
into mainstream contexts (b-boying in a series of low-
budget “breaksploition” movies in the early 1980s and
graffiti as part of a short-lived gallery trend around the
same time), neither developed substantially in those
environments. This, it has been suggested, was not so
much because the forms lacked appeal, but because—
on an economic level—b-boying was an advertisement
with no product. This reality is reflected in the phrase
that is often used to refer to this branch of hip-hop:
“hip-hop culture,” which suggests something that is
lived rather than bought and sold.

The second sense of the term hip-hop refers to a
form of popular music that developed, or was devel-
oped, out of hip-hop culture. This hip-hop, also known
as “rap music,” resulted from the interaction between
hip-hop culture and the preexisting music industry. As
we would expect, this hip-hop features elements of both
sensibilities. My students are often surprised when I
point out that, even when hip-hop lyrics seem to reject
every aspect of mainstream culture and morality, the
one thing they almost never reject is a strict 16-bar
verse structure derived from Tin Pan Alley pop music.
But this should not be surprising. This hip-hop, in con-
trast to hip-hop culture, is deeply intertwined with the
mass media and its needs, largely because it does have
a product: records, CDs, MP3s, and ringtones.

Passage B by Steve Stoute

It wasn’t until I was nine years old, late in 1979,
that I even heard the words “hip” and “hop” strung
together or was able to grasp the notion of what being a
rapper actually meant. That was when, fatefully, I heard
a record that changed my life (and pop culture) forever.

Like it’s yesterday, I can still remember that
moment over at my aunt’s home in Brooklyn—where it
seemed there was always a party under way with rela-
tives and neighbors hanging out, a great spread of food,
and new, hot music on the record player. Most stereo
systems in those days could be adapted for the single
two-sided records that were smaller and had the big
hole in the middle (45 RPM) as well as the bigger
records with the small holes (334 RPM)—which were
the full albums that had several songs on each side.

But as the intro plays to what I recognize as “Good
Times” by the group Chic and I’m drawn into the living
room because it’s a familiar hit song from the previous
summer, I encounter a record on the turntable that
defies categorization. Instead of the sweet female lead
vocals of that disco smash, I hear something totally dif-
ferent and spot a baby-blue label on the black vinyl
record I’ve never seen before. Even though it’s a
twelve-inch disc, the size of an album, as I listen to the
rhyming words being spoken—‘Singin’ on 'n’’n’ on ’n’
on / The beat don’t stop until the break of dawn /
Singin’ on ’n’ ’n’ on 'n’ on on ’n’ on / Like a hot
buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie pop da pop
pop / Ya don’t dare stop” —it hits me that this entire
side is one long song.

Almost fifteen minutes long as it turns out. Or, to
be exact, fourteen minutes and thirty-six seconds of
pure fun laid over the thumping bass beat from the
break of “Good Times” with sing-along words easy to
remember and repeat. The record, I discover, is by an
unknown group, the Sugarhill Gang, and is called
“Rapper’s Delight.”

From then on, nobody ever has to tell me what rap
is. It’s whatever words are spoken, chanted, or talk-
sung, or whatever philosophies, stories, or ideas are
espoused, by the house party Master of Ceremonies.

and its practices.

G. represented a significant development in American
popular culture.

H. was more popular than today’s rap music.

J. was slow to find an audience.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is from the article “The
Rise and Fall of the Living Fossil” by Ferris Jabr.

The term “living fossil” refers to creatures that had emerged
long ago and seemed to have stopped evolving.

Like all living fossils, crocodiles were thought to
have emerged in the distant past and then stayed largely
unchanged. The standard theory held that the crocodil-
ian species we know today originated in Africa during
the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago), when the
seven continents were much closer together. As the
continents drifted apart, the crocodilians went with
them, explaining how they ended up in a band of tropics
encircling the globe. If that were true, then modern
crocodilian species should be very different from one
another at the level of genes and molecules, because
there would have been more than enough time for sub-
stantial mutations to accumulate. By the 1990s, how-
ever, molecular analysis revealed that immune system
molecules conserved across living crocodilian species
were remarkably similar in structure and behavior.

Intrigued by this puzzle, a post-doctoral research
fellow at the University of Washington named Jamie
Oaks began collecting DNA samples from all 23 living
crocodilian species, comparing sections of the genome
where mutations were most likely to have appeared.
Although the fossil record had confirmed that ancient
crocodilians were more diverse than previously real-
ized, it also demonstrated that, on the whole, crocodil-
ians were not particularly swift evolvers compared to
mammals and other vertebrates. Even accounting for
this slower-than-average evolution, Oaks did not find
nearly as many differences between the modern croco-
dilian genomes as one would expect had those species
diverged all the way back in the Cretaceous. He con-
cluded that modern crocodilian species split from their
last common ancestor between 8 and 13 million years
ago, not long before ancient hominins split from their
last common ancestor with chimpanzees. The living
fossil theory of crocodiles had overestimated their evo-
lutionary age by about a factor of 10.

Oaks also noticed something odd about the DNA
samples he had acquired from the iconic Nile croco-
diles (Crocodylus nilotici hey did not match up with
each other. In fact, the variation between them was
great enough to suggest that he was looking at two dis-
tinct species. If so, then not only were modern croco-
diles much too young to be living fossils, but they had
also continued to speciate after diverging from their
basal ancestor—something living fossils are not sup-
posed to do. On its own, Oaks’ study was intriguing,
but not enough to convince the larger scientific commu-
nity to cleave the Nile crocodile into two species.

Unbeknownst to him, however, a separate team of
scientists was preparing to corroborate his results. In
the early 2000s, on an excursion to Chad, the wildlife
conservationist Michael Klemens encountered some
odd little crocodiles in a desert oa: They were so

docile that he and his companions could swim beside
them without concern. He took a tissue sample from
one that had recently perished and sent it to the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History in New York City,
where Evon Hekkala, an assistant professor at Fordham
University studying crocodilian diversity, sequenced its
genome. When she compared the docile croc’s DNA to
other Nile crocodiles, she noticed some rather striking
differences. She found similar reports of tame croco-
diles in Mauritania, and she remembered once reading a
description by the Greek historian Herodotus of ancient
Egyptians using mellow crocodiles in temple rituals.
Could these tame crocs be an entirely distinct species?

DNA analysis of 123 African crocodiles—as well
as 57 separate samples from museum specimens,
including crocodiles mummified in ancient Egypt—
confirmed her suspicion. In a few sections of their
respective genomes, all the mild-mannered crocs would
have one DNA sequence, and all the typical Nile crocs
another. They even had different numbers of chromo-
somes. “That made us very confident that there were
actually two different populations and they were not
mixing their DNA,” Hekkala says. The two different
species had diverged between 3 and 6 million years
ago: Crocodylus niloticus in the East and the smaller,
less aggressive Crocodylus suchus in the West. The vast
majority of mummified crocodiles were C. suchus, sug-
gesting that ancient Egyptians had recognized the
difference.

Together, Hekkala, Oaks, and other scientists
helped redraw the map of how crocodilians evolved in
space and time, and conclusively removed them from
the category of living fossils.

Which of the following statements best summarizes
Oaks’s analysis of Nile crocodiles’ DNA as it is pre-
sented in the third paragraph (lines 37-48)?

F. It suggested that Nile crocodiles are older than
what was previously believed, which does not sup-
port the living fossil theory of crocodiles.

It suggested that different species of crocodiles do
not share a basal ancestor, which the scientific
community has confirmed.

It suggested that the analysis was hastily done,
which prompted the scientific community to
ignore it.

It suggested that the DNA came from two species,
which did not support the living fossil theory of
crocodiles.

G.

The main purpose of the fifth paragraph (lines 67-82)

is to:

A. describe the DNA analysis that confirmed Croco-
dylus niloticus and Crocodylus suchus were two

distinct species.

provide information on the mummification of

crocodiles that was pertinent to Hekkala’s

analysis.

explain how Hekkala revolutionized DNA analysis

by comparing the DNA of 123 different African

crocodiles.

introduce the behavioral differences between

Crocodylus niloticus and Crocodylus suchus.

As it is used in line 3, the word standard most nearly
means:

F. accepted.
moderate.
normal.

regulated.

According to the passage, molecular analysis revealed
that immune system molecules from living crocodilian
species were similar in:

A. structure and behavior.
B. color and size.

C. density and age.

D. shape and weight.

In the context of the passage, the statement in
lines 53-55 mainly serves to:

F. indicate that Klemens and his companions
believed that the crocodiles were diseased.

G. establish the tameness of the crocodiles in the
desert oasis.

H. suggest that Klemens and his companions sus-
pected they were swimming with Crocodylus
niloticus.

J. indicate that the crocodiles in the desert oasis had

not yet fully matured.

According to the passage, after Klemens sent a tissue
sample of a perished crocodile to Hekkala, Hekkala
then:

estimated the crocodile’s age.

studied the crocodile’s immune system.

sequenced the crocodile’s genome.

identified mutations in the crocodile’s molecular
structure.

In the context of the passage, the detail that Crocody-
lus niloticus and Crocodylus suchus have different
numbers of chromosomes provides support for the
claim that the two species:

F. diverged during the Cretaceous.

G._ had similar diets.

H. did not evolve from the same ancestor.
J. were not mixing their DNA.

According to the passage, Crocodylus niloticus and
Crocodylus suchus diverged between:

A. 1 and 2 million years ago.

B. 3 and 6 million years ago.

C. 8 and 13 million years ago.
D. 66 and 145 million years ago.

Based on the passage, the phrase “redraw the map”
(line 84) is most likely meant to be read:

F. literally; scientists no longer believed crocodiles
originated in Africa.

G. literally; scientists no longer believed crocodiles
once lived in a band of tropics.

H. figuratively; scientists amended the narrative of
the natural history of crocodiles.

J. figuratively; scientists believe their findings will

have broader implications on archaeology.

Passage Ill

Two studies examined how the concentration of
Drug M in water affects the accumulation of Drug M in the
bodies of a species of planarian (a freshwater flatworm)
and the swimming speed of those planarians.

Study 1

Each of 24 dishes was prepared as follows: First,
20 mL of a 0.05 mg/L aqueous solution of Drug M was
added to the dish. Next, a single 0.04 g planarian was
placed in the dish. Finally, the dish was covered with a lid.
The dishes were then divided equally into 4 groups.

Each group was incubated at 20°C for a different
period of time. At the end of a group’s incubation period, a
l-microgram (Ug) tissue sample was collected from each
planarian in the group. The average biologic Drug M level
(BML, micrograms of Drug M per gram of tissue) was
determined for each group.

These procedures were repeated for a 0.20 mg/L and
for a 0.50 mg/L aqueous solution of Drug M (see Figure 1).

Twelve dishes were prepared using the 0.05 mg/L
aqueous solution of Drug M, as in Study 1, and were
divided equally into 4 groups.

Each group was incubated at 25°C for a different
period of time. At the end of a group’s incubation period,
each dish in the group was placed on top of a piece of
graph paper. The total number of gridlines crossed by each
planarian during a 4 min observation period was recorded.
The average swimming speed (the number of gridlines
crossed per minute) was then determined for each group.

These procedures were repeated for a 0.20 mg/L and
for a 1.80 mg/L aqueous solution of Drug M (see Figure 2).

Passage IV

A Crooke’s radiometer (CR) is a sealed glass bulb,
from which most of the air has been removed, that contains
4 metal vanes mounted on a spindle. The same side of each
vane is painted black, and the other is silver. See the
diagram.

diagram

When a CR is placed in light, the vanes rotate. For the
CR shown in the diagram, four students each provided an
explanation for the rotation and predicted the direction—
clockwise or counterclockwise—the vanes would rotate.

Student 1

Photons (particles of light) exert a greater force when
they are absorbed by a material than when they are
reflected by a material. This force is weaker than air resis-
tance, so it can cause rotation only when enough of the air
has been removed from the bulb. Photons are absorbed only
by the black side of each vane, exerting a stronger force on
that side that causes the vanes to rotate clockwise. The
brighter the light in which the CR is placed, the more pho-
tons are absorbed by the black sides and the faster the
vanes rotate.

Student 2

Student | is correct except that photons exert a greater
force when they are reflected by a material than when they
are absorbed by a material. Photons are reflected only by
the silver side of each vane, exerting a force that causes the
vanes to rotate counterclockwise.

ACT-F12

Student 3

The forces exerted by photons are too weak to cause
rotation of the vanes, even when most of the air has been
removed. Instead, photons absorbed by the black side of a
vane cause that side to heat up, warming the air molecules
in contact with it. Air molecules move from the cooler
silver side to the warmer black side. This produces a
greater air pressure on the black side and, thus, causes the
vanes to rotate clockwise. The brighter the light in which
the CR is placed, the greater the temperature difference
between the 2 sides of a vane and the faster the vanes
rotate.

Student 4

Student 3 is correct except that the air molecules
move from the warmer black side to the cooler silver side,
producing a greater air pressure on the silver side. This
causes the vanes to rotate counterclockwise.

20. Based on the explanation given by Student 1, which of
the following plots best shows the predicted relation-
ship between the brightness of light and the rotational
speed of the CR vanes?

Regardless of which student might be correct, for the
CR to function as described, which of the following
statements about the glass that composes the bulb of
the CR must be accurate? The glass must be able to:

A. prevent light from entering.
B. allow light to enter.
C. prevent heat from entering.
D. allow heat to enter.

In the process of thermal transpiration, gas molecules
move from a cooler area to a warmer area. Is thermal
transpiration more likely occurring in the process
described by Student 3 or in the process described by
Student 4 ?

F. Student 3; that student predicted that air molecules
would move from the cooler silver side to the
warmer black side.

G. Student 3; that student predicted that air molecules
would move from the cooler black side to the
warmer silver side.

H. Student 4; that student predicted that air molecules
would move from the cooler silver side to the
warmer black side.

J. Student 4; that student predicted that air molecules
would move from the cooler black side to the
warmer silver side.

Suppose the set of vanes in the CR shown in the dia-
gram has a mass of m. Further suppose the students
obtain a CR that is identical to the one shown in the
diagram except that the set of vanes has a mass of 10m.
If both CRs are placed in the same light, which set of
vanes is more likely to rotate faster? The set with a
mass of:

A. mz; the set with less mass would be easier to rotate.

B. m; the set with less mass would be more difficult
to rotate.

C. 10m; the set with more mass would be easier to
rotate.

D. 10m; the set with more mass would be more diffi-
cult to rotate.

Suppose that the silver sides of the vanes in the CR
shown in the diagram had been painted white instead.
Further suppose that when placed in light the vanes of
this CR still rotated. Would this finding be consistent
with the explanation given by Student 3 ?

F. Yes; the black side of each vane was likely warmer
than the white side, so the vanes should still have
rotated.

G. Yes; the black side of each vane was likely cooler
than the white side, so the vanes should still have
rotated.

H. No; the black side of each vane was likely warmer
than the white side, so the vanes should not have
rotated.

J. No; the black side of each vane was likely cooler
than the white side, so the vanes should not have
rotated.

Suppose that, when a photon is reflected by a surface,
it exerts twice as much force as when it is absorbed by
a surface. This information is consistent with the
explanation given by which student: Student 1 or Stu-
dent 2?

A. Student 1; that student stated that a greater force is
exerted on the black sides of the vanes.

B. Student 1; that student stated that a greater force is
exerted on the silver sides of the vanes.

C. Student 2; that student stated that a greater force is
exerted on the black sides of the vanes.

D. Student 2; that student stated that a greater force is
exerted on the silver sides of the vanes.

Passage V

The amount of heat, in joules (J), needed to raise the
temperature of | g of a substance by 1°C is the specific
heat (C,) of the substance. In an experiment, students
determined the C, of 5 metals: aluminum (Al), copper
(Cu), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), and tin (Sn).

Experiment

The students performed 5 trials for each of the metals.
In each trial, the students performed the following steps:

1. A 50.0 mL volume of H,O was placed in a beaker, and
then the beaker was placed in an ice water bath for
5 min.

2. While the H,O was cooling, a fresh 100.0 g sample of
room-temperature pellets of the metal was measured
out.

3. The beaker was removed from the ice water bath. A tem-
perature probe that recorded the temperature every 0.5 s
was inserted into the beaker. Then the H,O in the beaker
was stirred for 100 s.

4. The metal sample from Step 2 was then added to the
beaker while the contents of the beaker were stirred. The
H,O and metal were stirred for 120 s more while the
temperature probe continued recording the temperature
every 0.5 s.

5. The recorded temperatures were used to calculate, for
the moment the metal sample was added to the beaker,
the temperature change of the H,O (AT,,) and the corre-
sponding temperature change of the metal sample (AT,,).

ACT-F12

For each metal, the students calculated the average AT, and
the average AT,, and then used those values in calculating
an average C, value. The table lists, for each metal, the
atomic number, the average experimental C, value, and the
accepted C, value.

Passage VI

Water that has a pH less than 5.5 after it has flowed
through a coal mine is classified as acid mine drainage
(AMD). AMD is produced when groundwater flowing
through the mine interacts with iron disulfide (FeS,) in the
rocks. When FeS, dissolves in water, sulfate ions (SO,” ~)
are formed. These ions contribute to the low pH of AMD.

Coal combustion products (CCPs), such as the ash left
after coal is burned, can be mixed with water to produce
CCP grout (a substance similar to plaster). After a coal
mine is abandoned, the CCP grout can be injected into the
mine, where it hardens, coating all the exposed surfaces
and preventing the groundwater from coming into contact
with the rocks. A 5-year study was done to examine the
effects of injecting CCP grout into an abandoned coal
mine.

Study

On January 1, 1995, 3 water samples were collected at
the location where the groundwater first entered the mine.
The samples were analyzed for SO,° (in milligrams per
liter, mg/L), and the pH of each sample was determined.
The averaged results are shown in Table 1.

On January 1, 1995, and every 6 months after that,
3 water samples were collected at the location where the
groundwater flowed out of the mine. On August 1, 1996, a
volume of CCP grout sufficient to cover all exposed rock
surfaces was injected into the mine. The average
SO,° content and pH of the groundwater samples over the
5-year period are shown in Figures | and 2, respectively.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
