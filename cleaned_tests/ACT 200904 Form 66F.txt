Just take three of the most common misconceptions about

bats; that they are dangerous to humans, that they are
rodents, and that they cannot see.

In reality, only three of the more than 850 known
species of bats feed primarily on blood, and even

these do not draw nourishment from human blood;

bats are a kind of bird. Although winged, bats are not

related to birds, because even if a bat’s small, furry body

the greatest threat of all to bat survival.

In Remembrance of a Student Hero

[1] When Mario Savio died in 1996, newspaper

stories recounted the events that had put him in the
national spotlight more than thirty years earlier.
[2] In 1964, Savio was a philosophy major and a
member of the executive committee of the Free Speech
Movement at the University of California at Berkeley.

[3] During the height of the United States presidential

election campaign, the Free Speech Movement had
organized to fight the university's decision to limit the
activities of those groups on campus. [4] The son of
working-class parents, Savio grew up in Queens, New

Many of us have developed a frightening form of
selective blindness that allows us to pass by the

Why is an organization like the National Trust for
Historic Preservation so concerned about sprawi?
We're concerned because spraw} devastates older com-
munities, leaving historic buildings and neighborhoods
underused, poorly maintained or abandoned. We’ve
Jearned that we can’t hope to revitalize these communi-
ties without doing something to control the sprawl that
keeps pushing further and further out from the center.

But our concern goes beyond that, because preser-
vation today is about more than bricks and mortar.
There’s a growing body of grim evidence to support our
belief that the destruction of traditional downtowns and
older neighborhoods—places that people care about—is
corroding the very sense of community that helps bind
us together as a people and as a nation.

One form of sprawl—retai] development that
transforms roads into strip malls—is frequently spurred
on by discount retailers, many of whom are now con-
centrating on the construction of superstores with more
than 200,000 square feet of space. In many small
towns, a single new superstore may have more retail
space than the entire downtown business district. When
a store like that opens, the retail center of gravity shifts
away from Main Street. Downtown becomes a ghost
town,

There was! It was just an aster and J was just a total

10 And I remember the aster. Its rays were a brilliant
purple, its core a dense coin of yellow velvet. It focused

intimacy right away, however. This wasn’t going to be
an easy affair for either of us.

30 I'l give you an example of how it went. After 'd
owned the Peterson's for about a week, I went on a hike
with some friends up a little mountain, taking the book
along. Halfway up the mountain, there by the trailside
was a yellow flower, a nice opportunity to take my new
guide for a test drive. “Go on ahead!" I said to my
hiking companions, “I’}] be a minute...” Famous last
words.

I had already figured out the business of the
book’s colored tabs. I turned in an authoritative way to
the Yellow part and began to flip through. By the time
the last of my friends had disappeared up the trail, I'd
arrived at a page where things looked right. Five
petals? Yes. Pinnate Jeaves? Whatever. Buttercup?

Kenneth Libbrecht is a physicist at the California

tists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricul-

40 tural Research Service (ARS), his research is
uncovering new information about the magical world of

the ice surface’s “quasi-liquid” layer, which affects how
water molecules stick to the surface.

By manipulating the temperature and humidity

30 within an incubation chamber (and by adding an elec-

tric current or various gases at times), Libbrecht creates

“designer” snowflakes in his lab. Such experiments are
helping him determine how crystals form.

William Wergin, a retired ARS research biologist,
38 and a colleague, Eric Erbe, were using scanning elec-
tron microscopy to look at biological problems relating
to agriculture. To avoid the laborious procedure that
using such equipment usually entails, the two scientists
decided to freeze the tissue they were working with and

40 look at it in the frozen state.

“One day it happened to be snowing,” says
Wergin, “and we were looking for a specimen. We
imaged some snowflakes and were very surprised to see.
what we did.” It was the first time anyone had

48 attempted to image snow crystals with scanning elec-
tron microscopy, which provides precise detail about
the crystals’ shape, structural features and metamor-
phosed conditions (crystals often change once on the
ground depending on the surrounding environment).

50 Wergin called another ARS colleague, hydrologist

Albert Rango, to see if the snow crystal magnifications

Not only does the crystal research help gauge

85 snowmelt, it is also useful in predicting avalanches,

designing artificial snow, and, perhaps in the near

future, examining air pollution. “You can put snow ina

scanning electron microscope and tell which elements

are present, such as sulfur and nitrogen,” says Wergin.

90 “You can then see what kind of pollution is in the area
and possibly track the source.”

31. It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the
information about the scientific study of snow is pre-
sented primarily to: .

emphasize the importance of communication
among scientists.

explain how snow crystal facets influence the
snowpack in some western states.

showcase the varied uses of the scanning electron

Two measures of water quality are the number of
Escherichia coli bacteria present and the biotic index, BI (a
numerical valve based on the type, diversity, and pollution
tolerance of aquatic invertebrate animals). Both of these

emeasures.can be affected by water flow.

Aluminum warer-based paints (AWPs) contain alu-
minum (Al) flakes that give surfaces a shiny, metallic
appearance. If the flakes corrode, a dull coating of alu-
minum hydroxide forms on them:

.A sample of each fuel mixture listed in Table 1 was
burned in.a test engine at-an engine speed of 600 revolu-
tions -per-minute (rpm). The number of knocks per minute
‘was determined-for-each mixture. This was done so that an
octane number could be assigned to any fuel by measuring
its knock rate,

Experiment 2

Adding tetraethyllead (TEL) to a fuel changes its
octane number. Different amounts of TEL were added to
1,000 mL samples of isooctane. Each fuel mixture was
tested under the same conditions used in Experiment 1, and
the measured knock rate was used to determine the octane
number (see Figure 1).

Tomato. plants. grow-poorly:in high-salt environments.
This effect is caused by 2 processes:

+ A net movement of H,O between the cytoplasm of the
plants’ cells and the environment via osmosis .

» An increase in the cytoplasmic Na* concentration

The plant Arabidopsis thaliana carries a gene,
AINHX1, The product of this gene, VAC, facilitates uptake
of cytoplasmic Na* by the plant’s vacuoles.

A researcher created 4 genetically identical lines of
tomato plants (LI~L4). An AtNHX! gene from Arabidopsis
tialiana was isolated and 2 identical copies of this gene
were incorporated into L1’s genome. This process was
repeated with L2 and L3 using a different AINHX?/ allele
for each line, so that L1, L2, and L3 had different geno-
types for AINHX/, The researcher then did an experiment.

Experiment

Fifty seedlings from each of the 4 lines were grown in
10 L of nutrient solution for 80 days. The 10 L nutrient
solution contained H,O, 12 g of fertilizer, and 3 g of NaCl.
The nutrient solution was replaced every 5 days. After
80. days, average height, average mass (without fruit), and
average fruit mass (per plant) were. measured (see Table 1).

Passage Vil

When ‘a temperature difference (AT) exists between
the ends -of an insulated-metal rod (see Figure 1),:heat
flows from one end of the rod to the other. (AT = Ty - Te,

: where Ty and Te represent the temperature of the hotter end
and the colder end, respectively.)

The rate:at which-heat flows-is called the hear transfer

The following data apply to insulated copper rods.
Table 1 gives R versus AT for a 5 cm long rod with a cross-
sectional area of 3 cm’. In Figure 2, R is plotted against
length for rods having a AT of 30°C and a cross-sectional
area of 3 cm’. In Figure 3, R is plotted against cross-
sectional area for 5 cm long rods with a AT of 30°C.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests-on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table beiow to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked ary responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores, To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
