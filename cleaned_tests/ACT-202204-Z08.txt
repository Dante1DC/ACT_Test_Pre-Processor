This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On
the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered
to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are
lettered to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the
oval in that row lettered the same as your answer.
Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil
and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink
or a mechanical pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark
thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each
question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals
with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only
on the number of questions you answer correctly during
the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized
for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing
staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is
called for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a test on which time has
already been called, and you may not go ahead to
another test. To do so will disqualify you from the
examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called
at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill
in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |
Citizen Scientists Advance Astronomy at Home
Starting in 2007, volunteers around the
world began contributing via the Internet to
cutting-edge astronomical research. Galaxy Zoo,
a website developed at Oxford University, achieved
an immediate and extraordinary success, surprising
even the astronomers who created it.
Initially, project leaders invited the public to study

images gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

in order to classify galaxies as elliptical or spiral. | 2

There would likely be no cathedral to visit,
for instance, if not for Victor Hugo’s epic novel
Notre-Dame de Paris, commonly known as The Hunchback
of Notre-Dame. In the late 1700s, during the French
Revolution, much of the architectural icon was destroyed.

What builders and craftsmen, starting in 1163, had

then taken more then one hundred fifty years to create
20

were tumbling into ruins in politically tumultuous times.
2
The population of a city engulfed in chaos chose Notre

Dame as one of its targets, defacing statues, breaking
windows, and smashing furniture in an attempt to
remove any vestiges of royalty and of its religion.
Years later, in 1831, Victor Hugo published his
novel, the masterpiece offers a sweeping and brutal
look at issues of class and power in France. The first
novel to have beggars as protagonists, the book also
features the cathedral itself as a central character. So

By
popular was the story that one of its effects was to

spur the restoration of the cathedral, and Hugo had
2
portrayed as teetering on the brink of utter deterioration.

In addition to being exalted as a monumental work of
architecture, the cathedral emerging in Hugo’s

25
pages as embodying history—history worth

preserving with a vengeance. The actual work of

restoration was helped by Gothic Revival architect
26

his name is Eugéne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc.

PASSAGE III
Lobster Lore
In the early seventeenth century, lobsters were
plentiful among the New World. They could be gathered

3
by hand in shallow waters or caught by the dozens in

nets tossed over the sides of boats. After heavy storms,

for example, shorelines were often littered with lobsters,
2
sometimes in piles two feet high. Among European

colonists—though—plenitude did not lead to popularity.
3
Apocryphal stories have overemphasized this idea

that lobster was rarely eaten by choice. They claim that

servants’ contracts specified limits as to how often servants

would partake of lobster and that Boston dockworkers

went on strike, fed up with the indignity of being forced
to eat lobster as often as three times a week. Snippets
of quotations are often spun to bolster such stories of

colonists’ disdain for the crustacean. When welcoming
Ey
a new boat of colonists in 1622, William Bradford,

governor of Plymouth Colony, confessed, some say,
3
to his humiliation at having to serve lobster. But what he

expressed was regret over serving it, “without bread or

this: Lobster was plentiful. It was a good source of protein.

so much lobster and so little else, colonists indeed tired

of lobster. They preferred using it as fishing bait to

The problem with blue light

is a subject researchers have recently begun to study.

8

One function is, vision—the eye receives the input
4

necessary for sight. Additionally, the eye helps regulate
the body, using sensors in the retina that detect variations
in daylight. Based on the amount of light the retinas sense,
the body sets its internal clock to a twenty-four-hour cycle

called the circadian rhythm, which cues body functions,

0
such as digestion and blood pressure.

Crucial to the functioning of the circadian rhythm
is melatonin, a light-sensitive hormone secreted by the
brain. Melatonin promotes sleep. When the retina detects
bright light, the body suppresses melatonin to encourage

wakefulness. Still, melatonin production increases when

a

light levels drop, inducing drowsiness. Blue wavelengths

BI

of light are particularly adept at slowing melatonin release.

B. Yes, because it focuses on the ways that ledger art
has evolved since Montileaux’s time.
C. No, because it questions the accuracy of

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from
Unless: A Novel by Carol Shields (©2002 by Carol Shields).

From my mother I developed my love of flowers.
Their shapes came folded inside tiny seeds, so small
that fifty of them filled the bottom of a flat seed packet.
They were miraculously encoded from the beginning,
little specks of dark matter that we shook into our
hands, then sowed into flower beds. They sprouted,
then opened out in a studied and careful program of
increments. Now, that was astonishing, all those com-
pressed unfoldings and burstings, but no one said so.
No one made a fuss when the seeds actually performed:
sprouts, leaves, the long rivery stems, and finally the
intricacy of blossoms. I liked to tear the silk of the
petals between my fingers, rubbing the pollen into my
hands. “But that isn’t nice, Reta,” my mother said.
“Why would you want to hurt a beautiful flower?” I
didn’t believe this, that flowers hurt, but nevertheless I
didn’t do it again. I was the inept child searching for
those moments of calm when I would find adult valida-
tion or at least respite from my endless uncertainty.

I once scratched the banister with a spoon. My
mother rubbed it with butter, and the scratch went
away. She had no idea I had done it, her little girl
wouldn’t do a thing like that. With great good nature
they laughed when I said eggshells were made of plas-
tic, and also when I asked my father if we could buy
some icicles, long sculptured fingers of silvery ice that
lasted all winter. “Our little Reta,” they said, laughing.
I was afraid of drowning in their approval. There was
nothing hard to hang on to.

I had no siblings, but I closely observed small
babies who entered our house, the children of my par-
ents’ friends. There they lay, tiny, bundled, smelling
like spoiled milk, wound tight in fleece blankets. From
the beginning I saw that they possessed a patient even-
ness of curiosity that reduced and simplified the mys-
teries thronging our household. They didn’t worry as I
did about the halo around the head of the baby Jesus,
what it was made of, what kept it hovering over his
head and traveling along with him wherever he went.
They put their small hands on the plastic-ribbed face of
the radio in the kitchen and laughed at the vibrations
that poured out. I could see that they accepted simple

electrical transmission for what it was, whereas I had
special knowledge available to me: I knew there were
little people living inside the radio’s shell, the obliging
citizens of a miniature village that clung to a steep dark
mountain.

It wasn’t neglect that spawned the ignorance I was
captive to. Adults were too busy to deliver complicated
explanations. In fact, it was partly the busyness of my
parents that frightened me, the frantic responsibility
that preoccupied them. Their job was to keep us alive.
It never occurred to them that I worried about the fact
that I could see through my nose when I looked to the
left or right, straight through, except for the fleshy
blurred outline. And certainly neither of them stopped
to express their own bafflement about the universe they
inhabited, that they too might be swamped by barely
grasped concepts. My slender, long-legged father
patrolling the garden, leaning down to inspect an iris;
he possessed a gardener’s watchfulness and did not
appear to reel with wonder at this serenely formal
flower, that its cape and collar opened out of a tightly
packed bulb, every part of it predestined and perfectly
in place. He was a dealer in early Canadian pine furni-
ture and as a sideline worked as a distressor; that is, he
took modern limited editions of books and battered
their pages and their boards into decent old age, giving
them the tact and smell of history.

The moon followed me. When I staggered, seven
years old, across the grass in the backyard, my head
thrown back, willing myself to be dizzy, I could see
how the moon lurched along with my every step, keep-
ing me company as I advanced toward the peony bed.
Why, out of all the people in the world, had I been
chosen as the moon’s companion? What did this mean?
Honour, responsibility, blame, which?

I confided to my friend Charlotte this curious busi-
ness about the moon. But she insisted that, on the con-
trary, the moon followed her. So back to back, at the
end of the lane we paced off steps, she one way, I the
other. Immediately I grasped the fact that the moon fol-
lowed everyone. This insight came mostly as a relief,
only slightly tarnished with disappointment.

The fact is, I didn’t need to know everything and
no one expected it of me in the first place.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from Extra Virgin-
ity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil by Tom
Mueller (©2012 by Tom Mueller).

“If I were a king, I'd eat nothing but fat.” Thus a
seventeenth-century farmer expressed his longing for
triglycerides, both saturated and unsaturated, five cen-
turies before they fell from medical and culinary
favor—and before hydrogenation made them danger-
ous. Fats and oils are a remarkably efficient fuel, not
only for lamps and furnaces and the olive’s germinating
seed, but for people as well. In times of unrelenting
manual labor and ever-present cold, when most
people’s main preoccupation was how to fill their bel-
lies, fatty foods were associated with health and
prosperity.

But which fat to choose—saturated or unsatu-
rated? Animal fat or olive oil? By the late Middle Ages
in Europe, the battle line between these ancient antago-
nists more or less followed the modern border between
Tuscany to the south and Emilia-Romagna to the north.
South of this line, olive oil was the favored condiment
for vegetables, soups, and fish both grilled and fried. To
the north, in Italy and beyond the Alps, where olive
trees didn’t thrive because of the cold, a few olive oil
aficionados existed among the upper classes, but animal
fat held sway among the masses except during Lent and
fast days. Northern Europeans had mixed emotions
about olive oil. They prized it for its sacred symbolism
and medicinal properties, yet disliked its bitterness and
bite, so different from the sweet animal fats used to
season their native comfort foods. If they ate olive oil at
all, they preferred milder oils like those grown on the
shores of Lake Garda, but often enough they simply
kept the substance well away from their mouths.
Hildegard of Bingen, the German abbess, mystic, poet,
and polymath, spoke for many northerners when she
concluded that olive oil was excellent medicine but
miserable food, which “causes nausea when eaten, and
ruins other foods when cooked together with them.” Or
perhaps Hildegard and her sisters were getting bad oil.
Thomas Platter, an English traveler of the late sixteenth
century, observed that only low-grade olive oil reached
northern Europe, pressed from the lees after the good
oil had already been extracted.

A new campaign in the enduring culinary war
between olive oil and animal fat began in the fifteenth
century, with the triumphant arrival of butter. This inva-
sion came about through subtle changes in dietary
custom, and a gradual loosening of Rome’s grip on
food that occurred in the run-up to the Reformation. In
certain areas of northern Europe, where no olives grew
and residents had little taste for oil, modifications in
canon law permitted the consumption of butter during
Lent and fast days, opening the door to widespread sub-
stitution of butter for olive oil.

French and English cooks began to replace olive
oil with this milder-tasting fat, long a part of their

indigenous cuisine, and to weed out Mediterranean
influences in their cooking. As far south as Sicily, cer-
tain gastronomes and gourmands sang the praises of
this wondrously sweet new condiment. In his influential
cookbook Libro de Arte Coquinaria, written about
1450, Maestro Martino, court chef to the patriarch of
Aquileia, instructs his readers to prepare maccaroni
siciliani with fresh butter and spices rather than with
oil. A contemporary play has a group of Venetian gen-
tlemen sitting down to plates of maccaroni covered
with vast quantities of cheese, cinnamon, sugar, and “so
much butter that they swam in it.” Butter even worked
its way into the dreams of the poor, like the family of
sharecroppers in Modena who left their fields and
moved across the river into Lombardy, “because there,
it’s said, you get gnocchi with plenty of cheese, spices,
and butter.” From the fifteenth century down through
the nineteenth, the struggle between oil and butter was
brought to life in European paintings, literature, and
street dramas.

Still, most southern Europeans remained faithful
to olive oil, not only because of their ancient devotion
to Mediterranean fare but because butter struck many of
them as unnatural, even dangerous. Nobles at the court
of Mantua packed ample stores of oleum bonum for a

80 journey to England, and the cardinal of Aragon, travel-

ling in the Low Countries in 1517, brought along his
personal cook and a generous supply of olive oil. If
some chefs pushed butter, others championed oil: a new
generation of cookbooks appeared in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, primarily in southern Italy, which
proposed an exciting new multiethnic Mediterranean
cuisine oozing with oil.

The passage as a whole can best be described as:

A. an argument that olive oil is a better source of
nutrition than is butter, as evidenced by the health
of Europeans from France to southern Italy.

B. an examination of where, when, and to what
degree butter replaced olive oil as a prized ingredi-
ent in the European diet.

C. an overview of the role religion has played in
determining the diet of Europeans since the seven-
teenth century.

D. a comparison of olive oil and other types of cook-
ing oils in terms of their culinary merits and health
benefits.

Which of the following words is used in the passage in
a way that is more figurative than literal?

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: Passage A is adapted from the book A Natural
History of the Piano by Stuart Isacoff (©2011 by Stuart Isacoff).
Passage B is adapted from the essay “Oscar Peterson, My
Teacher” by Mike Longo (©2011 by Stuart Isacoff).

Passage A by Stuart lsacoff

For Oscar Peterson the piano had long been a
trusted companion—sparking early dreams, conferring
a place in the history books, and easing his way in a
world of racial strife. Now, at eighty-one, he looked
worn out. Arriving at the stage of New York’s landmark
jazz club Birdland, he struggled to move onto the piano
bench.

Yet, as soon as the keyboard was within reach, he
thrust out his right arm and grabbed a handful of notes;
at that signal, the bass player, drummer, and guitarist
launched into their first number. And suddenly there
was that sound. He still had it—a musical personality as
large as life, steeped in tradition yet recognizably,
unmistakably all its own.

For dazzling technique, he followed the lessons of
the European classical tradition, culled from childhood
sessions first with his sister, Daisy, then with local
pianist Louis Hooper and the Hungarian teacher Paul de
Marky. He was so serious about his lessons as a young
boy that he would practice for up to eighteen hours at a
time, he said, on days “when my mother didn’t drag me
off the stool.” De Marky was a good model: he had
studied in Budapest with Stefan Thoman, who had stud-
ied with the great Franz Liszt—a musical titan of his
day and the founder of modern piano technique.

De Marky trained Peterson in that great tradition,
and assigned the pianist other staples of the repertoire,
such as Chopin’s treacherously difficult Etudes. And as
he taught Peterson, Paul de Marky honed in on
Chopin’s most important trait. “I don’t hear the melody
singing,” he would tell his student. “The melody is
choppy. Make it sing.” And so the works of the cele-
brated classical composers—great improvisers, all—
served as his training ground.

Paul de Marky also encouraged Oscar Peterson’s
immersion in the jazz canon. Peterson remembered,
“What I loved about him was that he was not short-
sighted. He was a fantastic classical pianist. But I
would come to him for a lesson, and he’d be playing
jazz records”—greats like Teddy Wilson, Nat “King”
Cole, and Duke Ellington. “Their playing served as my
rudiments,” he reported.

Oscar Peterson’s rise to the top of the jazz pan-
theon was based on a formula that merged the classical
European tradition and the homespun American one.
But he focused especially on a common denominator he
had found in the approach of all the greats: their refusal
to settle for anything less than a full command of their
resources. “I never tried to sound like a trumpet or a
clarinet,” he said. “I was taught to respect [this instru-

ment] for what it was: a piano. And it spoke with a cer-
tain voice.” He had always striven, he explained, to be
the kind of musician who could take advantage of the
entire keyboard, of everything the instrument was capa-
ble of producing.

Passage B by Mike Longo

During the 1960s I had the honor of being Oscar
Peterson’s private student. He and some colleagues had
started a school for contemporary music, and though
there had to be around fifty students, after about two or
three weeks he took me under his wing. From that time
on, I saw him three or four times a week, instead of the
usual once. He gave me the key to his studio so I could
practice on his piano. That was necessary, because he
had me practicing thirteen hours a day.

He transformed my playing. I had already gradu-
ated college as a piano major, but no one had ever
spoken to me about my physical approach to the instru-
ment. I was playing with my wrist down. He had me
raise it, and taught me to play without a lot of arm
weight. The technique originated with Liszt; it allows
you to strike the keys without ever exerting yourself.

He also taught me the true meaning of piano
“style,” which has to do with developing a personal
sound. Think of all the jazz organists, he said, who each
have a tremendous number of “stops” at their disposal,
mechanical devices on the instrument that change the
quality of the sound. Despite that variety of choice,
they all use the same ones, so every jazz organist ends
up sounding exactly like Jimmy Smith, the jazz master
who popularized the instrument. To have real style, he
explained, means to create a sound that is instantly rec-
ognizable as yours.

So Oscar Peterson didn’t let his students play like
him—or like anybody else, for that matter. One day I
was using chord voicings [particular spatial arrange-
ments of the tones in a harmony] like those of Bill
Evans and he yelled: “You know that’s not you!” He
had a formula for achieving beautiful results at the
piano. He called it “the five T’s”: touch, time, tone,
technique, and taste. Of course, he had them all.

musical style as:

A. predictable and clichéd, borrowing from anti-

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Gene Behind van Gogh's Sunflowers Pinpointed” by Helen
Thompson (©2012 by Nature Publishing Group).

A team of plant biologists has identified the gene
responsible for the ‘double-flower’ mutation immortal-
ized by painter Vincent van Gogh in his iconic Sun-
flowers series.

Van Gogh’s 1888 series includes one painting in
which many of the flowers depicted lack the broad dark
centre characteristic of sunflowers and instead com-
prise mainly golden petals. This was not simply artistic
license on van Gogh’s part but a faithful reproduction
of a mutant variety of sunflower. Researchers at the
University of Georgia report that they have pinned
down the gene responsible for the mutation, which
could shed light on the evolution of floral diversity.

A wild sunflower is not so much a single flower as
a composite of tiny florets. The golden ray florets,
located at the sunflower’s rim, resemble long petals, are
bilaterally symmetrical and do not produce pollen. That
job belongs to the disc florets, tiny radially symmetrical
blossoms that occupy the sunflower’s darker centre. In
combination, the two types of florets create the impres-
sion of a single large flower, and presumably an attrac-
tive target for insect pollinators.

Because changes in floral symmetry can affect
how a plant interacts with pollinators—and therefore its
reproductive fitness—the unusual sunflowers depicted
by van Gogh piqued plant biologist John Burke’s
curiosity.

He says that the diversity of traits seen in many
species of flowering plants are thought to be related to
the ‘CYC-like’ class of genes, named after the gene
CYCLOIDEA. CYC-like genes control DNA transcrip-
tion and influence floral morphology in Gerbera daisies
and flowering weeds from the Senecio genus—which
belong to the same family as sunflowers—but their
function in sunflowers has been less understood.

“It’s been hypothesized that these genes could be
responsible for driving the evolution of floral head
diversity,” says Burke.

Double-flowered mutants present geneticists with
a practical challenge as their relative lack of pollen
makes it difficult to generate offspring. To surmount
this, the researchers began by crossing a wild-type sun-
flower with a partial double-flowered mutant and then
allowing the offspring to self-pollinate. Among the off-
spring was a new mutant with ‘tubular’ flowers, so
named because of their resemblance to soda straws. The
researchers soon traced the differences between mutant
and wild-type sunflowers to insertions of chunks of
DNA in the gene HaCYC2c. In the double-flowered
mutants, there was one insertion; in the tubular flowers,
there were two.

ACT-Z08

31.

Previous studies had shown that HaCYC2c is
highly expressed in ray flowers. The researchers found
that in the double-flowered mutants, the first insertion
increased HaCYC2c expression in all floral tissues,
causing the centre disc flowers to appear more ray-like.
In the tubular mutants, the second insertion mutation
stops transcription of the gene, preventing proper ray
flowers from forming.

“Tt looks like this gene is a key player in determin-
ing ray versus disc morphology in sunflowers,” says
Burke. “Basically, if you turn the gene on in the wrong
place, it'll cause disc flowers to look like ray flowers.
Conversely, if you knock the gene out, it causes the ray
flowers to become more disc-like.”

The researchers constructed a family tree tracking
HaCYC2c over different sunflower family species. The
results suggest that mutations in the gene evolved inde-
pendently to influence floral shape, confirming earlier
studies.

Because sunflowers can reproduce by self-
pollination and cross-pollination between individuals, it
is possible that the mutations leading to tubular florets
represent an adaptation. Ray flowers produce no pollen
but attract pollinators, so the mutation could be an
advantage in circumstances in which only self-
pollination is likely. “When the plants are invading a
new area, and there aren’t as many pollinators—why
put energy into a ray floret when you don’t need to
attract pollinators?” says Richard Abbott, a biologist.

In contrast, the double-flowered mutation immor-
talized by van Gogh is unlikely to have been an adap-
tive feature, as such plants would have difficulty
reproducing. “This sort of thing would be selected
against under natural conditions,” says Mark Chapman,
a co-author. “This was presumably a random mutation.”

In fact, says Chapman, it is likely that human plant
breeders have perpetuated the mutation because of its
striking appearance. But although the mutation it car-
ries conveys a disadvantage, it has offered a window
into the evolutionary history of the sunflower family.

The passage presents a study that examines the genetic
differences among which of the following sets of three
sunflower varieties?

A. Wild, double-flowered, and tubular

B. Mutant, golden, and composite

C. Wild, daisy-like, and flowering

D. Self-pollinating, cross-pollinating, and HaCYC2c

The main purpose of the third paragraph (lines 14-22)

is to:

F._ indicate that wild sunflowers are unattractive to
insect pollinators.

G. explain how a wild sunflower’s disc florets
blossom.

H. describe some of the physical characteristics of a
wild sunflower.

J. suggest that wild sunflowers are actually one
single large flower.

As it is used in line 9, the word faithful most nearly
means:

A. sacred.

B. resolute.

C. affectionate.
D. accurate.

It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that
unlike the bilaterally symmetrical blossoms of a wild
sunflower, the radially symmetrical blossoms:

F. have golden petals.
G. attract light.

H. have long petals.
J. produce pollen.

According to the passage, what role did van Gogh’s
painting of mutated sunflowers play in the study
presented in the passage?

A. The painting revealed that artists often take cre-
ative license when representing objects in nature,
contradicting Burke’s findings that the sunflowers
existed.

B. The sunflowers in the painting confirmed Burke’s
hypothesis that mutant sunflowers were primarily
cultivated naturally in the late nineteenth century.

C. The unusual sunflowers depicted in the painting
intrigued Burke and prompted him to study the
mutation and its existence.

D. The painting demonstrated that van Gogh was
familiar with plant biology and early theories
about genetic mutations.

The passage states that changes in floral symmetry are
important because they:

F. lead to the creation of tubular flowers.
G. affect a plant’s reproductive fitness.

H. indicate an increase in a flower’s pollen.
J. suggest a need for greater floral diversity.

37.

38.

39.

40.

According to the passage, what do Gerbera daisies,
sunflowers, and flowering weeds from the Senecio
genus have in common?

A. They are from the same family of flowers.

B. They are mutant varieties of their respective
species.

C. They are composed of mostly ray florets.

D. They are identical in their DNA makeup.

It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the
practical challenge geneticists face when studying
double-flowered mutants is that the flowers:

F. are comprised of the same genetic structure with
each new generation of mutations.

G. have a genetic structure that is often confused with
that of Gerbera daisies.

H. lack the gene HaCYC2c, complicating the study of
floral head diversity for geneticists and plant
biologists.

J. have difficulty reproducing, making it challenging
for geneticists to identify patterns across
generations.

As it is used in line 42, the word crossing most nearly
means:

A. navigating.
B. breeding.
C. marking.
D. bisecting.

The passage states that although the mutated sun-
flowers depicted in van Gogh’s painting are at a disad-
vantage, studying the mutation is important because it:

Passage |

The 4 common halide ions are fluoride (F-), chloride
(Cl), bromide (Br ), and iodide (I). A halide in solution
can be identified by mixing the solution with various test
solutions and observing the precipitates (solids), if any,
that form.

Table 1 shows the results of mixing each of 4 color-
less aqueous halide solutions with a colorless aqueous test
solution containing calcium (Ca**), silver (Ag*), thallium
(TI*), or lead (Pb™*).

Table 2 shows the results of mixing each of 2 color-
less aqueous solutions (A and B) with each test solution.
Each of Solutions A and B is a combination of 2 of the
halide solutions.

Passage Il

A study performed at a site off the Mediterranean
coast examined how an ocean storm during the winter
affected wave height, current speed, and the rate of
sedimentation.

Study

Before the winter storm season began, 3 types of
instruments were anchored to the ocean floor in water 26 m
deep (see Figure 1). A wave height buoy, which was
attached to its anchor with an elastic cord, contained a
device that measured its vertical movements in the waves.
An acoustic profiler, fixed in position 2.5 m above the
ocean floor, used sound waves to measure the horizontal
speed of the ocean current at that depth. A pair of sediment
traps, fixed at the same distance above the ocean floor as
the acoustic profiler, collected sediment that settled out of
the water.

From November 4 to November 24, the average wave
height, in meters (m), and the average current speed, in
centimeters per second (cm/sec), were determined daily
(see Figures 2 and 3, respectively). The mass of sediment,
in grams (g), deposited per square meter (m”) of ocean
floor per day (the sedimentation rate) was also determined
daily over those 21 days (see Figure 4). A strong storm
affected the site beginning the morning of November 12.

Passage Ill

Scientists studied how perceived predation (hearing
the calls and sounds of predators), in the absence of direct
predation, affects the production of offspring by female
song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). M. melodia sparrows
produce 2 clutches (groups) of eggs in a breeding season.

Study

At the beginning of a breeding season, 24 M. melodia
nests without eggs were located in low-growing shrubs.
Direct predation was eliminated by surrounding each shrub
with an electric fence to protect the nest from ground
predators and by covering each shrub with a net to protect
the nest from aerial predators.

The nests were evenly divided into 2 groups: a preda-
tor treatment (PT) group and a nonpredator treatment
(NPT) group. A speaker that broadcast the calls and sounds
of predators of M. melodia was set up near each nest in the
PT group. A speaker that broadcast the calls and sounds of
nonpredators of M. melodia was set up near each nest in
the NPT group.

Throughout the breeding season, each speaker broad-
cast the appropriate calls and sounds every few minutes on
a 4-day-on, 4-day-off cycle. (The parents and offspring
associated with each nest did not hear sounds emitted by
speakers other than their own speaker.) The number of eggs
and the number of hatchlings produced in each nest were
recorded. The number of hatchlings that successfully left
each nest (such hatchlings are called fledglings) was also

recorded. The figure shows, for each group, the average
number of offspring (as eggs, as hatchlings, and as fledg-
lings) per nest in each clutch.

Suppose that 1 yr after the sparrows fledged, the scien-
tists wanted to determine how many fledglings from

dures, if it had been part of this study, would have
enabled the scientists to monitor the fledglings’ sur-
vival | yr later?

F. Feeding the hatchlings in both groups extra food
before they fledged

G. Tagging the hatchlings in both groups with identi-
fying markers before they fledged

H. Removing the nets from the shrubs of the PT
group before the fledglings left their nests

J. Preventing the hatchlings in the NPT group from
leaving their nests by covering the nests with nets
having smaller holes

rows have fewer fledglings when exposed to the calls
and sounds of predators than when exposed to the calls
and sounds of nonpredators” is consistent with the
results of the study for which of the clutches, if either?

Passage IV

As a banana ripens, the external peel changes color
and the chemical composition of the internal pulp changes.
Three experiments were performed to study the ripening of
bananas.

Experiment 1

On Day 0, 100 bananas were harvested from the same
banana plant. All the banana peels were completely green,
so the average peel color “completely green” was assigned
to the group. Next, the bananas were stored under ripening
conditions (16°C and 85% relative humidity) over the next
35 days. Every 7 days during that time period, the bananas
were inspected and a new average peel color was assigned.
The relationship between average peel color and time is
shown in Table 1.

Table |

Day Average peel color

0 | completely green

7 | green with yellow streaks
14 | yellow with green tips
21 | completely yellow
28 | yellow with brown spots
35 | brown

Experiment 2

On each day that an average peel color was assigned,
the following procedures were also performed: First,
3 bananas were randomly selected from the group and
peeled. Then, the pulps of the 3 bananas were thoroughly
mixed together, and a 100 g sample of the pulp mixture
was collected. Next, an 80% solution of ethanol in H,O (by
volume) was mixed with the sample to extract the starch
and the sugars from the sample. Then, the mass, in g, of the
starch in the sample and the mass, in g, of the sugars in the
sample were determined (see Figure 1).

but higher than the mass of glucose in the sample?

A. Day 7
B. Day 14
C. Day 21
D. Day 28

In Experiment 2, why were the bananas that were
selected from the group selected randomly rather than
nonrandomly?

F. To increase the likelihood that the bananas would
be representative of the group

G. To decrease the likelihood that the bananas would
be representative of the group

H. To increase the likelihood that the bananas that
remained in the group would be those having
starch and sugars in their pulps

J. To decrease the likelihood that the bananas that
remained in the group would be those having
starch and sugars in their pulps

27.

Do the results of Experiment 2 indicate that each
sample of pulp mixture contained only starch and
sugars?

A. Yes, because for any given day of testing, the sum
of the mass of starch in the sample and the mass of
sugars in the sample was equal to 100 g.

B. Yes, because for any given day of testing, the sum
of the mass of starch in the sample and the mass of
sugars in the sample was not equal to 100 g.

C. No, because for any given day of testing, the sum
of the mass of starch in the sample and the mass of
sugars in the sample was equal to 100 g.

D. No, because for any given day of testing, the sum
of the mass of starch in the sample and the mass of
sugars in the sample was not equal to 100 g.

The ethanol solution used in Experiment 2 was pre-
pared by mixing 80 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of H,0.
Which of the following expressions gives the percent
by volume of ethanol in this solution?

80 mL ethanol

80 mL ethanol
J. (aC ORCS) x 100%

The variation in the mass of starch and in the mass of
sugars in the banana pulps over the 35 days, as shown
in Figure 1, depended on the process of osmosis.
Which of the following statements about the transfer of
water or soluble substances in the bananas is consistent
with this information?

A. As water was transferred from peel to pulp, the
mass of starch in the pulps decreased and the mass
of sugars in the pulps increased.

B. As water was transferred from peel to pulp, the
mass of starch in the pulps increased and the mass
of sugars in the pulps decreased.

C. As soluble substances were transferred from peel
to pulp, the mass of starch in the pulps decreased
and the mass of sugars in the pulps increased.

D. As soluble substances were transferred from peel
to pulp, the mass of starch in the pulps increased
and the mass of sugars in the pulps decreased.

Passage V

Spheres W, X, Y, and Z, initially at rest at the starting
line on an inclined plane, will be released one at a time and
allowed to roll, without sliding, all the way to the finish
line at the bottom of the incline. The masses and radii of
Spheres W and X are compared in the following table, as
are the masses and radii of Spheres Y and Z.

Spheres Properties
Spheres have the same radius.
Wand X W has the greater mass.
Spheres have the same mass.
YandZ Y has the greater radius.

A teacher asks 2 students to predict whether Sphere W
or Sphere X, if either, will reach the finish line in less time,
and whether Sphere Y or Sphere Z, if either, will reach the
finish line in less time.

Student 1

Sphere W will reach the finish line in less time than
Sphere X. Sphere W weighs more than Sphere X, so the
force of gravity exerted on Sphere W is greater than that
exerted on Sphere X. Because force = mass x acceleration,
Sphere W will have the greater acceleration down the
incline and, therefore, the greater average speed.

Sphere Y will reach the finish line in less time than
Sphere Z. For 2 spheres having the same mass, as sphere
radius increases, sphere density decreases, so the energy
required for a sphere to complete a rotation decreases. The
mass of Sphere Y is spread over a greater volume than
is the mass of Sphere Z, so Sphere Y is less dense than
Sphere Z and will have the greater acceleration and the
greater average speed.

ACT-Z08

46

Student 2

Spheres W and X will reach the finish line in the same
amount of time. The acceleration of a sphere due to gravity
is independent of the sphere’s mass, so the 2 spheres will
have the same acceleration and, therefore, the same aver-
age speed.

Sphere Z will reach the finish line in less time than
Sphere Y. For spheres having the same mass, as sphere
radius increases, the energy required for a sphere to com-
plete a rotation increases. This is because as sphere radius
increases, the distance traveled by the sphere to complete a
rotation increases. Therefore, because Sphere Y has the
greater radius, it will have the lesser acceleration and the
lesser average speed.

28. Sphere S has a mass of 10 kg, and Sphere T has a mass
of 20 kg. The 2 spheres have the same radius. If both
spheres are dropped from the same height at the same
instant, Student | would more likely predict that which
sphere will hit the ground first?

(Note: Assume that air resistance is insignificant.)

F. Sphere S, because the force of gravity on Sphere S
would be greater than the force of gravity on
Sphere T.
Sphere S, because the force of gravity on Sphere S
would be less than the force of gravity on
Sphere T.

G.

H. Sphere T, because the force of gravity on Sphere T
would be greater than the force of gravity on
Sphere S.

J. Sphere T, because the force of gravity on Sphere T

would be less than the force of gravity on
Sphere S.

Based on the information in the table, which sphere,

tance down the incline.

C. Sphere Z, because it has the lesser radius.

Suppose the spheres were tested on the Moon instead
of on Earth. Based on Student 2’s prediction, which
sphere, Sphere W or Sphere X, if either, would reach

F. Sphere W, because on the Moon, the mass of
Sphere W would be greater than the mass of
Sphere X.

Sphere X, because the weight of each sphere
would be less on the Moon than on Earth.

G.

H. Neither sphere, because the mass of each sphere

pendent of the sphere’s mass.

Passage VI

Microtubules (MTs), which are structural components
of cells, continuously elongate and shorten. An MT in
catastrophe stops elongating and starts to shorten. An MT
in rescue stops shortening and starts to elongate. When a
cell enters mitosis from interphase, these transitions con-
tribute to the rearrangement of the MT structure to form
the mitotic spindle.

Table 1 shows the values of 3 parameters that were set
in 6 computer-simulation models (CSMs A-F) of MT pop-
ulations. It also shows the known values of the parameters
for interphase cells and mitotic cells.

and the rescue frequency was 0.000 MTs/sec for
CSM D.

G. Yes; the catastrophe frequency was 0.056 MTs/sec

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely
blank, do not calculate a Composite score.
