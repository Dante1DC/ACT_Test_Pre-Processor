of a queen in the salvage yard, The work of art had such a

poor drought management can have on an area’s

ecosystem. Would this essay accomplish that goal?

dying spruce tree to illustrate the greater devasta-
tion to the area,

B. Yes, because il criticizes the Santa Fe govern-
meat’s response to the drought for compounding
the damage to the surrounding ecosystem,

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel The
Bonesetter's Daughter by Amy Tan (©2001 by Amy Tan).

The setting of the passage Is a small town in China during the
early part of the twentieth century. The capital city of China,
now known in English as Beijing, formerly was called Peking.

When I was growing up, nearly two thousand
people lived in Immortal Heart. It was crowded, packed
from one edge of the valley to the other, We had a brick
maker, a sack weaver, and a dye mill. We had tweaty-
four market days, six temple fairs, and a primary school
that GaoLing and I went to when we were not helping
our family at home. We had all kinds of peddlers who
went from house to house, selling fresh bean curd and
steamed buns, twisted dough and colorful candies. A
few coppers, that was all you needed to make your
stomach as happy as a rich man’s.

The Liu clan had lived in Immortal Heart for six
centuries. For that amount of time, the sons had been
inkstick makers who sold their goods to travelers. They
had lived in the same courtyard house that had added
rooms, and later wings, when one mother four hundred
years ago gave birth to eight sons, one a year. The
family home grew from a simple three-pillar house to a
compound with wings stretching five pillars each,

All in all, our family was successful but not so
much that we caused great envy. We ate meat or bean
curd at almost every meal. We had new padded jackets
every winter, no holes. We had money to give for the
temple, the opera, the fair, But the men of our family
atso had ambitions. They were always looking for
more. They said that in Peking, more people wrote
important documents. Those important documents
required more good ink. Peking was where more of the
big money was, Around 1920, Father, my uncles, and
their sons went there to sell the ink. From then on, that
was where they lived most of the time, in the back
room of a shop in the old Pottery-Glazing District.

In our family, the women made the ink, We stayed
home. We all worked—-me, GaoLing, my aunts and girl
cousins, everybody, Even the babies and Great-Granny
had a job of picking out stones from the dried millet we
boiled for breakfast. We gathered each day in the

inkmaking studio, According to Great-Granny, the
studio began as a grain shed that sat along the front
wall of the courtyard house. Over the years, one gener-
ation of sons added brick walls and a tile roof. Another
strengthened the beams and lengthened it by two pil-
lars. The next tiled the floors and dug pits for storing
the ingredients. Then other descendants made a cellar
for keeping the inksticks away from the heat and cold.

Because our ink was the best quality, we had to
keep the tables and the floors clean year-round. With
the dusty yellow winds from the Gobi Desert, this was
not easy to do, The window openings had to be covered
with both glass and thick paper. In the summer, we
hung netting over the doorways to keep out the insects.
In the winter, it was sheep hides to keep out the snow.

I can still smelt the ingredients of our ink, There
were several kinds of fragrant soot: pine, cassia, cam-
phor, and the wood of the chopped-down Immortal
Tree, There was also a glue of sticky paste mixed with
many oils. Then we added a sweet poisonous flower
that helped resist insects and rats. That was how special
our ink was, all those lasting smells.

We made the ink a little at a time. If a fire broke
out, as it had a couple of hundred years before, all the
supplies and stock would not be lost at once. Each of us
had at least one part in a long list of things te do,
First there was burning and grinding, measuring and
pouring. Then came stirring and molding, drying and
carving. And finally, wrapping and counting, storing
and stacking. One season I had to wrap, only that. My
mind could wander, but my fingers stilt moved like
small machines. Another season I had to use very fine
tweezers to pluck bugs that had fatlen onto the sticks,
Whenever GaoLing did this, she left too many dents.
Precious Auntie’s job was to sit at a long table and
press the sooty mixture into the stone molds. When the
ink was dry, she used a long, sharp, tool to carve the
good-luck words and drawings into the sticks. Her cal-
ligraphy was even better than Father's.

Tt was boring work, but we were proud of our
secret family recipe. It yielded just the right color and
hardness. An inkstick of ours could last ten years or
more. It did not dry out and crumble, or grow soggy
with moisture. And if the sticks were stored in the cool-
ness of a root cellar, as ours were, they could last from

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“High Over Kitly Hawk, Looking for a Profil” by Paul Hoffman
(©2003 by The New York Times Company).

The foggy lens of history has been kind to Wilbur
and Orville Wright. We regard the boys from Dayton,
Qhio, as American heroes who flew the first airplane
and ushered in the age of air travel. At the time, though,
the brothers’ achievement was barely recognized—and
their. motives were far from visionary,

On Dec. 17, 1903, the Wrights took turns making
short ascents over the dunes of Kill Devil Hills, four
miles south of Kitty Hawk, N.C., in a propeller-driven
biplane powered by an internal combustion engine.
They each got airborne twice—with Wilbur going the
farthest, 852 feet in 59 seconds——before a gust flipped
the plane while it was on the ground.

But what was really so historic about the flight?
The Wrights were certainly not the first people to rise
above the Earth, Balloonists had been doing that for
more than a century, In June 1783, Joseph and Etienne
Montgolfier, paper makers from Aanonay, France,
demonstrated in a public square the first hot-air balloon
capable of carrying a load as heavy as a human being.

The Wrights were also not the first to pilot a
heavier-than-air craft. In 1849, Sir George Cayley, a
British physicist, constructed a three-winged glider that
lifted a 10-year-old child a few feet. After four years of
further experimentation, Cayley enlarged his “boy
glider” into an adult-size craft and sent a grown man
through the air for several hundred feet.

Nor were the Wright brothers the first to achieve
powered flight. In 1901, a Brazilian named Alberto
Santos-Dumont entertained all of Paris by making a
14-mile trip over the city, including a revolution of the
Eiffel Tower, in a cigar-shaped balloon powered by a
car engine.

The Wrights were not even the first to leave the
ground in a powered plane. In 1874, Félix du Temple, a
French naval officer, watched the steam-powered plane
he devised speed down a ski-jump-like ramp and sput-
ter through the air with a young sailor at the helm.

OF course, it is one thing to be hurled through the
air for a few fleeting moments—what aviation histori-
ans cal] a “hop”——and quite another to make a con-
trolled flight under one’s ow power. Control is what
the Wright brothers so ably and singularly demon-
strated. While other aviation pioneers concentrated on
how to power a plane—not a difficult task by the time
automobile engines had come into their own—the
Wrights focused on how to stabilize it.

Many early aviation pioneers employed horizontal
and vertical rudders to keep their experimental aircraft
from veering right or left or unintentionally diving or

il.

rising. But only the Wrights appreciated another neces-
sity: preventing the plane from suddenly rolling
because of a difference in wind on the left and right
wings. They ingeniously countered roll by “wing-
warping’-—-using flexible wing tips with wire controls
so that the pilot can bring the right wing into the wind
at a different inclination from the left one, creating lift.

Thus while the brothers’ flights were remarkable,
they were hardly bolts from the blue. Rather, their
achievement was a vital step in a long progression
toward controlled flight. And by no means did their
success make them overnight celebrities: in 1903
hardly anyone heard about their flights, and those who
did were not inclined to believe the tale.

The Wright brothers chose the Outer Banks of
North Carolina not just for the favorable winds, but
also for the remoteness. They wanted to fly in near
secrecy because they weren't sure they could patent
their plane, and wanted to profit from it before others
knocked off the design. Yet, they expected the Press to
hail them as the conquerors of the air,

But reporters were skeptical. Six days before Kitty
Hawk, a crowd of official witnesses and Washington
bigwigs had gathered to watch what was supposed to be
the maiden flight of the giant Aerodrome designed by
Samuel Langley, the head of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The plane was catapulted from a houseboat in the
Potomac but instead of rising into the air plunged into
the frigid waters. News reporters could not accept that
two bicycle mechanics with little money had succeeded
while the dean of American science, financed with gov-
ernment money, had failed.

The few newspapers that wrote about Kitty Hawk
gol everything wrong. The Dayton Daily News
described the Wrights’ aircraft.as a dirigible and
planted the story under the headline “Dayton Boys
Emulate Great Santos-Dumont.” The first eyewitness
account of their subsequent flights was published more
than two years after Kitty Hawk, in an obscure maga-
zine called Gleanings in Bee Culture.

The point of view from which the passage is told is
best described as that of:

A. a writer with a historical perspective who wants.to
correct misconceptions about early flight.

a relative of the Wright brothers who wants to
build a monument in their honor.

an inventor who wants to illustrate how difficult it
is to invent something important.

an observer of the initial Kitty Hawk flight who is
critical of how it was reported, both then and later.

12, What does the passage indicate was the main differ-

ence between the Wright brothers’ aircraft and the
works of other inventors?

I. The Wright brothers succeeded in flying when

other inventors had failed.

Other inventors used balloons, not heavier-than-air

craft.

No other inventors had used both horizontal and

vertical rudders.

J. The Wright brothers prevented the rolling of a
plane while other inventors had concentrated on
powering a plane,

According to the passage, what was one reason
reporters were skeptical that the Wright brothers had
successfully flown?

A. The first story of the Wright brothers’ flight was
not published for two years.

it was widely assumed that the Wright brothers.
wanted to profit from their ideas.

A leader in science with government funding had
failed to have his own plane fly.

Balloonists had already been flying for more than
acentury.

The main purpose of the last paragraph is to show that
the Wright brothers:

F were successful in their attempt to fly.

had merely duplicated what Alberto Santos-
Dumont had done earlier.

were initially poorly covered by the media,

The main purpose of the second paragraph (lines 7-13)

is to:

A. argue that more people should admire the Wright
brothers for their accomplishments.

B. explain why it took two years for the first eyewit-
ness account of the Wright brothers’ initial flight
to be published.

C, detail the first successful flights of the Wright
brothers near Kitty Hawk.

D. clarify that it took many more years before the air-
plane was perfected.

nearly means:

F. political rebellion.
G. radical change.
H. circular course.
J. pivotal invention.

The passage makes clear thal it became easier for
inventors to power their aircraft after:

A. the Wright brothers flew near Kitty Hawk.

B. automobile engines had been developed,

C. they started adding horizontal and vertical rudders,
D. Sir George Cayley perfected his “boy glider.”

The statement “they were hardly bolts from the blue”
(line 59) most strongly suggests that flights like the
Wright brothers’ were:

FE unsurprising.
G. improbable.
H. unusual.

J. remarkable.

The passage makes clear that one personal reason the
Wright brothers had for testing their aircraft where
they did was to:

A. avoid the negative publicity that would come if
their plane failed to fly.

keep away anyone who couldn’t help if something
went wrong during the test flight.

maintain confidentiality despite the many inter-
views they had previously given.

make money from their invention by isolating it
from potential imitators. ‘

It can most reasonably be inferred from the tenth para-
graph (lines 65-71) that the author believes:

KF. the Wright brothers shouldn't have expected to be

praised by the press.

North Carolina was too windy for flying experi-

mental aircraft safely.

secrecy is necessary for inventors.

J, reporters can’t be trusted to get their information
correct.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “The
Comics” by M. Thomas Inge (©1990 by Smithsonian institution).

Comic art has much in common with all the other
forms of literary and visual communication of the twen-
tieth century. As in fiction, the elements of narrative,
characterization, and setting are important in accom-
plished comic art; and as in poetry, ideas must be devel-
oped within a very short period of reading time, a few
seconds for a comic strip and fifteen minutes or less for
a comic book story. As in drama, a story or incident
must be staged before our eyes within the artificial
strictures of a box-like frame and with all the limita-
tions of a play in terms of compressed time, dialogue,
and plot development, As in a motion picture, such
visual devices as culting, framing, close-ups, and mon-
tage are used by the comic artist, and the point-of-view
is free to roam the world over to places known and
fantastic.

Although the comics share a good deal with other
forms of artistic expression, they differ in distinct ways
and provide a method of communication which is ulti-
mately unique, For one thing, comics depend for their
effectiveness on a balanced combination of word and
picture, the one depending fully on the other for maxi-
mum effect. Thus some commentators have suggested
that in comic strip art, if either the picture or the text is
not essential to understanding, then a proper balance is
lacking.

There are other essential features of comic art,
which distinguish it from other art forms. For example,
comic strips appear on a daily basis in newspapers
delivered to homes, while comic books appear on a
monthly basis in special serial publications soid at
newsstands or comic book shops {and more recently a
few bookstores), Both are usually printed on inexpen-
sive paper, and while comic books generally appear in
color, comic strips have traditionally been in color oaly
on Sundays,

Another distinguishing feature is that most comic
strips and books feature a set of recurring characters
with whom the reader becomes familiar over a period
of time, with an occasional retelling of their past histo-
ries in capsule form. It is the accumulative weight of
familiarity over several months or years of reading
experience with the characters through which the devel-
opment of personality occurs, although many characters
remain essentially the same throughout their lifetimes.
Especially in humor, a set of stock and stereotyped
players is essential to the daily comic routines, formu-
laic repetition being one of those techniques which
most often make people laugh (as in Charlie Brown's
unsuccessful attempt to kick the football held annually
by Lucy in the Peanuts comic strip).

Time is also treated differently in that generally it
has-no effect on the lives of characters in the comics.
They do not grow old chronologically (with the notable

exception of Gasoline Alley in which several genera-
tions of a family have grown old along with the read-
ers). The dramatic narrative is open-ended and the
action, whenever the reading experience begins, is
always somewhere in the middle. Thus comics charac-
ters inhabit a world that has no beginning and no end,
that-remains constant and is shored up against the usual
influences of change and deterioration. Only in the case
of politically satiric strips, such as Doonesbury, Bloom
County, or Pogo, are immediately contemporary events
and personalities reflected or depicted in the comics.

Since comics characters inhabit a world of silence,
due to the restrictions of the printed page which cannot
allow for motion and sound, dialogue and noise require
a special set of conventions. Words are usually spoken
in cloud-like puffs of smoke called bailoons. Because
of the limited amount of space, dialogue must be kept
to an absolute minimum and the joke or story told with
the fewest words possible, a continual challenge to the
skills of the writer of a comic. As for sounds, the comic
artist must resort to the poetic device of onomatopoeia,
and while many traditional words such as slam, bang,
sock, sniash, ov bump will serve the situation, new word
coinages have proven necessary. Thus the comics have
enriched American English by such contributions as
wow, plop, cowie, bam, and whap. In order to convey
ideas which cannot be expressed with words, the comic
artist has also developed a vocabulary of visual sym-
bols, such as bubble balloons for silent thoughts, stars
to show pain, drops of water to express labor or worry,
or radiating lines to convey pride or enlightenment. It is
remarkable how effective these conventions ar cre-
ating the impression of a loud and noisy medium.

Suppose a reader had composed the following sum-
mary of the passage:

Comic art has been an important part of U.S.
culture for decades, reflecting the historical
and aesthetic changes within the country and
its changing values.

Would this be an effective summary of the passage?

A. Yes, because the passage focuses on how comic
artists have used their art to reflect the changing
culture,

Yes, because the passage focuses on how comic
artists have developed their own storytelling meth-
ads over many decades.

No, because the passage focuses on the established
practices that comic artists have traditionally used
in comic art.

No, because the passage focuses on the connec-
tions between comic art and film.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted from The Blind
Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins (©1986 by Richard Dawkins).

The South American and the African weakly elec-
tric fish are quite unrelated to each other, but both live
in the same kinds of waters in their respective conti-
nents, waters that are too muddy for vision to be effec-
tive. The physica! principle that they exploit—etectric
fields in water—is even more alien to our conscious-
ness than that of bats and dolphins. We at least have a
subjective idea of what an echo is, but we have almost
no subjective idea of what it might be like to perceive
an electric field. We didn’t even know of the existence
of electricity until a couple of centuries ago.

It is easy to see on the dinner plate that the mus-
cles down each side of any fish are arranged as a row of
segments, a battery of muscle units. In most fish they
contract successively to throw the body into sinuous
waves, which propel it forward. In electric fish, both
strongly and weakly electric ones, they have become a
battery in the electric sense. Each segment (cell) of the
battery generates a voltage. These voltages are con-
nected up in series along the tength of the fish so that,
in a strongly electric fish such as an electric eel, the
whole battery generates as much as [| amp at 650 volts.
An electric cel is powerful enough to knock a man out.
Weakly electric fish don’t need high voltages or cur-
rents for their purposes, which are purely information-
gathering ones.

The principle of electrolocation, as it has been
called, is fairly well understood at the level of physics
though not, of course, at the level of what it feels like
to be an electric fish, The following account applies
equally to African and South American weakly electric
fish: the convergence is that thorough. Current flows
from the front half of the fish, out into the water in
lines that curve back and return to the tail end of the
fish, There are not really discrete ‘lines’ but a continu-
ous ‘field,’ an invisible cocoon of electricity surround-
ing the fish’s body. However, for human visualization it
is easiest to think in terms of a family of curved lines
leaving the fish through a series of portholes spaced
along the front half of the body, all curving round in the
water and diving into the fish again at the tip of its tail.
The fish has what amounts to a tiny voltmeter monitor-
ing the voltage at each ‘porthole.’ If the fish is sus-
pended in open water with no obstacles around, the
lines are smooth curves, The tiny voltmeters at each
porthole ail register the voltage as ‘normal’ for their
porthole. But if some obstacle appears in the vicinity,
say a rock or an item of food, the lines of current that
happen to hit the obstacle will-be changed. This will
change the voltage at any porthole whose current line is
affected, and the appropriate voltmeter will register the
fact. So in theory a computer, by comparing the pattern
of vollages registered by the voltmeters at all the port-
holes, could calculate the pattern of obstacles around
the fish. This is apparently what the fish brain does,
Once again, this doesn’t have to mean that the fish are

ACT-O7E

clever mathematicians, They have an apparatus that
solves the necessary equations, just as our brains
unconsciously solye equations every time we catch a

60 ball.

It is very important that the fish’s own body is
kept absolutely rigid. The computer in the head
couldn’t cope with the extra distortions that would be
introduced if the fish’s body were bending and twisting

65 like an ordinary fish. Electric fish have, at least twice

independently, hit upon this ingenious method of navi-
gation, but they have had to pay a price: they have had
to give up the normal, highly efficient, fish method of
swimming, throwing the whole body into serpentine

70 waves. They have solved the problem by keeping the

body stiff as a poker, but they have a single long fin ail ,
the way along the length of the body. Then instead of
the whole body being thrown into waves, just the long
fin is. The fish’s progress through the water is rather

75 slow, but it does move, and apparently the sacrifice of

fast movement is worth it: the gains in navigation seem
to outweigh the losses in speed of swimming. Fascinat-
ingly, the South American electric fish have hit upon
almost exactly the same solution as the African ones,

80 but not quite. Both groups have developed a single long

fin that rans the whole length of the body, but in the
African fish it rans along the back whereas in the South
American fish it rans along the belly.

31. Which of the following questions about the South

American and African weakly electric fish does the
passage NOT directly answer?

. What do they use electrolocation for?

. What effect does their differing fin location have?

. What do the voltmeters on the fish do?

. Why do they swim more slowly than ordinary
fish?

A. tip of the tail and is reabsorbed into the head.

B. head and is reabsorbed into the portholes.

Passage Il

Some students experimentally determined g, the
acceleration due to gravity.

In each trial, the students suspended a spring from a
stand and measured the spring’s length, L. They attached a
mass to the suspended spring, allowed the spring-mass
system to come to rest, and measured the length, y, of the
extended spring (see Figure 1).

Then they calculated the distance D = y ~ L.

Next, they pulled the mass down to the release point,
R, and released it, allowing the mass and spring to oscil-
late, Using a sensor and a computer, they plotted the dis-
tance of the mass from Point R oyer time (see Figure 2).

Passage Ill

As human life expectancy increases, people are
becoming more familiar with the complex signs of aging;
however, scientists still do not completely understand what
causes aging at the molecular level.

Three scientists propose models to explain the human
aging process.

Scientist I

Aging is caused by the shortening of telomeres, spe-
cialized DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes,
Telomeres play an important roie in protecting and repli-
cating chromosome ends. Each time a cell replicates its
DNA and divides, its telomeres become shorter. Eventu-
ally, the telomeres become too short to perform their neces-
sary roles, and the cell is no longer able to divide,
ultimately causing defects in cell structure and function
that result in aging.

Scientist 2

Aging is caused by random DNA damage that accu-
mulates over the lifetime of somatic (nonreproductive)
cells, As humans age, the DNA in their somatic cells accu-
mulates damage that is not repaired, This results in muta-
tions that cause defects in proteins and in gene expression,
leading to aging. Most DNA damage is caused by free
oxygen radicals (oxygen species containing oxygen atoms
with unpaired electrons) formed during metabolic
processes. Thus, the accumulation of DNA damage can be
slowed by decreasing the rate of metabolism. Although
telomeres do become shorter each time a cell divides, this
occurs too slowly to affect the aging process.

Scientist 3

Aging is caused by mutations present in each human
at birth that usually produce defects after an individual is
too old to reproduce, Because individuals with these muta-
tions reproduce, the mutations can be passed on to the next
generation and maintained in the population. Thus, aging is
caused by the mutations that humans inherit from their par-
ents, This is why closely related individuals tend to have
similar life expectancies, Telomere shortening occurs too
slowly to affect the aging process, and DNA damage from
free oxygen radicals is easily repaired.

ACT-67F

42

12. Based on the passage, would Scientist | or Scientist 3
be more likely to argue that the process of cell division
contributes directly to aging, and why?

F, Scientist 1, because according to Scientist 1,
telomeres become shorter each time a cell divides.
G, Scientist 1, because according to Scientist 1,
telomeres become longer each time a cell divides.
H. Scientist 3, because according to Scientist 3,
telomeres become shorter each time a cell divides.
J. Scientist 3, because according to Scientist 3,

telomeres become longer. each time a cell divides.

13. How does Scientist 2's model differ from Scientist 3’s
model? Scientist 2 claims that the mutations that cause
aging:

A. are due to telomere shortening, whereas Scientist 3
claims that the mutations that cause aging are
present at birth,

accumulate throughout a human’s life span,
whereas Scientist 3 claims that the mutations that
cause aging are due to telomere shortening.

whereas Scientist 3 claims that the mutations that
cause aging are present at birth,

14, Scientist 1’s model would be most weakened if which

of the following observations were made?

KF, Telomeres are the same length in both young cells
and old cells.

The telomeres in a baby’s cells are longer than the
telomeres in an adult’s cells.

More free oxygen radicals are produced by young
cells than by old cells.

More free oxygen radicals are produced by old
cells than by young cells.

G.
H.
J.

15.

All 3 scientists would most likely agree with which of
the following statements about telomeres?

A. Telomeres become shorter as a human ages.

B. Telomeres remain the same length throughout a
human’s life span.

Telomeres become longer as a human ages,
Changes in telomere length are responsible for
aging.

Passage IV

A siver’s discharge is the volume of river water flow-
ing past a location in the river in a given amount of time.
Discharge is affected by several factors, including the area
of the river’s drainage basin (the land surface that delivers
the rainwater that falls on it into the river) and the spatial
relationship of the river to other rivers.

Two studies examined the discharge in 3 rivers—the
North River, the Jones River, and the Calm River—follow-
ing a rainfall event. As shown in Figure |, the drainage
basin of the North River and the drainage basin of the
Jones River are within the drainage basia of the Calm
River. The area of each river's drainage basin is given in
kilometers”,

Study 1

The rainfall event produced 25 mm of rain. As rain-
water drained into the 3 rivers, the discharges of the rivers
increased. The maximum discharge measured immediately
after a rainfall event is called a flood.

Over the 12 days following the rainfall event, as the
flood caused by the rainfall moved downstream, the dis-
charge was continuously measured, in m*/sec, at the 3 sites
shown in Figure i. The results are shown in Figure 2,
(Note: No rainfall event occurred in the Calm River
drainage basin during those 12 days.)

Study 2

The normalized discharge over the 12 days following
the rainfall event was calculated for each of the 3 rivers.
The normalized discharge values allowed the flood to be
studied as if the 3 rivers had identical drainage basin areas
of 1 km*. Each normalized discharge value was calculated
using the following equation:

23.

22, A student predicted that the river with the greatest

maximum discharge would also have the greatest max-
imum normalized discharge. Based on Figures 2 and 3,
is the student’s prediction correct?

KF Yes, because the North River had both the greatest
maximum discharge and the greatest maximum
normalized discharge.

G. Yes, because the Calm River had both the greatest
maximum discharge and the greatest maximum
normalized discharge.

H. No, because the North River had the greatest max-
imum discharge but the Calm River had the great-
est maximum normalized discharge.

J. No, because the Calm River had the greatest maxi-
mum discharge but the North River had the great-
est maximum normalized discharge.

Based on Figures | and 2 and the description of
Study 2, the normalized discharge of the Calm River
5 days after the rainfall event was most likely calcu-
lated using which of the following expressions?

A. 3,000 km? + 28,400 m/sec
B. 3,000 m/sec + 28,400 kn’?
C. 28,400 km* + 3,000 m’/sec
D, 28,400 m/sec + 3,000 km?

Suppose that discharge in the Jones River had been

measured at a site north of the area where the rainfall

event occurred, instead of at the site indicated in

Figure |. How would the discharge data recorded after

the rainfall event have differed from that shown in

Figure 2 7

F. No flood would have been recorded in the data for
the North River.

G, No flood would have been recorded in the data for
the Jones River.

H. The flood recorded in the data for the North River
would have been greater than 700 m/sec.

J. The flood recorded in the data for the Jones River
would have been greater than 1,500 m’/sec.

Passage VII

Volcanoes put sulfur into the troposphere and the
stratosphere, where the sulfur reacts to form sulfate
aerosols (liquid droplets suspended in air). For locations at
5O°N latitude, aerosols present at altitudes below I] km
scatter incoming solar energy, resulting in cooler air, while
aerosols present at higher altitudes absorb incoming solar
energy, warming the air.

Figure { shows the air temperature deviation at the
surface of, and at 2 different altitudes above, a particular
volcano (located at 50°N tatitude), before and after it

with their teacher’s beliefs. In your opinion, should teachers
express their personal opinions about political and social issues
in the classroom?

In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write
about either one of the two points of view given, or you may
present a different point of view on this question. Use specific
reasons and examples to support your position.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score, Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score ihal corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test Is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the biank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score fs 1.

Directions

This booklet contains tests in English,

* Mathematics, Reading, and Science. These tests

measure skills and abilities highly related to high

school course work and success in college.

CALCULATORS MAY BE USED ON THE
MATHEMATICS TEST ONLY.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered.
On the answer document, the rows of ovals are
numbered to match the questions, and the ovals in
each row are lettered to correspond to the suggested
answers. .

For each question, first decide which answer is
best. Next, locate on the answer document the row
of ovals numbered the same as the question. Then,
locate the oval in that row lettered the same as your
answer. Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft
lead pencil and make your marks heavy and black.
DO NOT USE INK OR A MECHANICAL PENCIL.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you
change your mind about an answer, erase your first
mark thoroughly before marking your new answer.
For each question, make certain that you mark in the
row of ovals with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be
based only on the number of questions you answer
correctly during the time allowed for that test. You will
NOT be penalized for guessing. [T /S TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION
EVEN IF YOU MUST GUESS.

You may work on each test ONLY when your test
supervisor tells you to do so. If you finish a test
before time is called for that test, you should use the
time remaining to reconsider questions you are
uncertain about in that test. You may NOT look back
to a test on which time has already been called, and
you may NOT go ahead to another test. To do so will
disqualify you from the examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is
called at the end of each test. You may NOT for any
reason fill in or alter ovals for a test after time is
called for that test. To do so will disqualify you from
the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.
