ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
‘one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

Ukulele Life

My older sister was a guitar buff and my idol when I
was growing up. She would teach me songs on her acoustic
guitar now and then after school and on long family road
trips to the beach. In those moments, my sister and I were
the closest we’ve ever been. And my guitar itself felt like,
well, family.

When my sister left Chicago for college in California,

I began carting my guitar around everywhere: to school,
rr

to work, to friends houses. Years later, my guitar
3

accompanied me on business trips. No matter where I was,
er

playing it made me feel a little bit closer to home.

a miniature guitar. Warm, mellow tones accrued from
the instrument, complementing the lyrical rhythm of
the Hawaiian words he sang. It was a ukulele.

As soon as I could, I bought a ukulele of my own.
I began to linger on the beach, where several native
Hawaiians often played. I watched them for hours, my
ukulele in my hands, and practiced. Unlike the guitar,
which has six strings, my ukulele had four; to make
the same chords with the uke, I had to learn completely
different finger positions. I also had trouble with dexterity
at first because the neck of the uke is much narrower

then that of a guitar. I had to retrain my fingers to make

Hedy Lamarr, Across the Spectrum

In 1940, Hedy Lamarr was becoming a Hollywood

star, but she was bored. On set for only three months
of the year, she filled her spare time with an unusual
hobby: inventing. World War I] was underway in
Europe, where Lamarr had grown up, and she hoped
to invent something to help the Allied cause. Because
Lamarr’s former husband had often discussed his

work in munitions, the actress knew about weaponry.

She had ideas of her own, including an idea of hers

16
for a torpedo with a sophisticated radio-controlled

guidance system. [17] Lamarr knew that radio signals

on one frequency is easy to jam by anyone sending a
8

competing signal on the same frequency. She envisioned a
system that used dozens of frequencies to transmit a
signal to guide torpedoes. To protect the signal further,
transmitters and receivers would jump from frequency

to frequency in a predetermined order that would seem
random to an outsider. Such a signal like that would be
hard to detect and nearly impossible to disrupt.

[1] In August 1940, Lamarr met composer George
Antheil, and the two began collaborating. [2] Antheil, who
had synchronized player pianos for his compositions, had
the mechanical knowledge that Lamarr needed to instigate
her idea. [3] Then in 1942, the inventors heard that the
Navy had rejected their idea. [4] They submitted the
“Secret Communication System” to the military in June
1941. [5] In the decades after the war, however, the US
military discovered the value of Lamarr’s idea, which
came to be called “spread spectrum,” and used it in

guidance, radio, and navigation systems. [=]

Question 30 asks about the preceding passage
as a whole.

30. Suppose the writer’s primary purpose had been to give
an overview of the history of an important invention.
Would this essay accomplish that purpose?

F. Yes, because it recounts the story of Lamarr and
Antheil’s invention of spread spectrum and the
invention’s significance.

G. Yes, because it shows how Lamarr and Antheil
changed the course of World’ War II by inventing
spread spectrum.

H. No, because although it describes Lamarr and
Antheil’s invention, it does not establish the
importance of spread spectrum.

J. No, because it instead focuses on Lamarr, Antheil,

Passage |

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
short story “Pride” by Alice Munro (2011 by Alice Munro).

Oneida didn’t go to school with the rest of us. She
went to a girls’ school, a private school. Even in the
summers she was not around much. I believe the family
had a place on Lake Simcoe.

5 Oneida was an unusual name. Her father, I believe,
called her Ida. Ida’s father ran the bank. Even in those
days bankers came and went, I suppose to keep them
from ever getting too cozy with the customers. But the
Jantzens had been having their way in town for too long

10 for any regulations to matter, or that was how it
seemed. Horace Jantzen had certainly the look of a man
born to be in power. A heavy white beard and a ponder-
ous expression.

In the hard times of the Thirties people were still
15 coming up with ideas. You can be sure, men were
nursing a notion bound to make them a million dollars.

A million dollars in those days was a million dollars.

It wasn’t any railway bum, however, who got into

the bank to talk to Horace Jantzen. Who knows if it was

20 a single person or a cohort. Maybe a stranger or some

friends of friends. Well dressed and plausible looking,

you may be sure. Horace set store by appearances.

He wasn’t a fool, though maybe not as quick as he
should have been to smell a rat.

25 The idea was the resurrection of the steam-driven
car, such as had been around at the turn of the century.
Horace Jantzen may have had one himself and had a
fondness for them. This new model would be an

improved version, of course, and have the advantages of _

30 being economical and not making a racket.

T’m not acquainted with the details, having been in
high school at the time. But I can imagine the leak of
talk and the scoffing and enthusiasm and the news get-
ting through of some entrepreneurs from Toronto or

35 Windsor or Kitchener getting ready to set up locally.
Some hotshots, people would say. And others would
ask if they had the backing.

They did indeed, because the bank had put up the
loan. St was Jantzen’s decision and there was some con-

ACT-A10

40 fusion that he had put in his own money. He may have

done so, but he had also dipped improperly into bank
funds, thinking no doubt that he could pay it back with
nobody the wiser. Maybe the laws were not so tight
then. There were actually men hired and the old Livery
Stable was cleared out to be their place of operations.
And here my memory grows shaky, because I graduated
from high school, and I had to think about earning a
living if that was possible. I settled for bookkeeping,
and that meant going out of town to apprentice to an
outfit in Goderich. By the time I got back home the
steam-car operation was spoken of with scorn by the
people who had been against it and not at all by those
who had promoted it. The visitors to town who pro-
moted it had disappeared.

The bank had lost a lot of money. There was talk
not of cheating but of mismanagement. Somebody had
to be punished. Any ordinary manager would have been
out on his ear, but given that it was Horace Jantzen this
was avoided. What happened to him was almost worse.
He was switched to the job of bank manager in the little
village of Hawksburg, about six miles up thé highway.
Prior to this there had been no manager there at all,
because they didn’t need one. There had just been a
head cashier and an underling cashier, both women.

Surely he could have refused, but pride, as it was
thought, chose otherwise. Pride chose that he be driven
every morning those six miles to sit behind a partial
wall of cheap varnished boards, no proper office at all.
There he sat and did nothing until it was time for him to
be driven home. The person who drove him was his
daughter. Sometime in these years of driving she made
the transition from Ida to Oneida. At last she had some-
thing to do.

If | picture Oneida and her father on these journeys
to and from Hawksburg, I see him riding in the back
seat, and her in front, like a chauffeur. It may have been
that he was too bulky to ride up beside her. I don’t see
Oneida looking downtrodden or unhappy at the arrange-
ment, nor her father looking actually unhappy. Dignity
was what he had, and plenty of it. She had something
different. When she went into a store or even walked on
the street there seemed to be a little space cleared
around her, made ready for whatever she might want or
greetings she might spread. She seemed then a bit flus-
tered but gracious, ready to laugh a little at herself or
the situation. Of course she had her good bones and

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: Passage A is adapted from Plastic: A
Toxic Love Story by Susan Freinkel (©2011 by Susan
Freinkel). Passage B is adapted from American Plastic: A Cul-
tural History by Jeffrey L. Meikle (©1995 by Jeffrey L. Meikle).

Passage A by Susan Freinkel

Designers were enthralled by the universe of pos-
sibility from plastics’ earliest days. They Joved the
design freedom that synthetics offered and the spirit of
modernity the materials embodied. To furniture
designer Paul T. Frankl, a material like Bakelite, the
world’s first synthetic plastic, spoke “in the vernacular
of the twentieth century . . . the language of invention,
of synthesis,” and he urged his fellow designers to use
their full imaginative powers to explore the new materi-
10 als’ frank artificiality. As interpreted by Frankl and
other designers working with Bakelite in the "30s and
’40s, that was the language of streamlining, a lingo of
curves and dashes and teardrop shapes that created a
feeling of speed and motion in everyday objects.
Streamline a fountain pen and even that stolid item
declared: we’re hurtling toward the future here!

a

1

There was another reason designers embraced
plastics. From the mid-twentieth century on, modern
design has been guided by an egalitarian gospel, a

20 belief that good design needn’t cost a lot of money, that
even the most mundane items could be things of beauty.
“Get the most of the best to the most for the least” was
the way Ray and Charles Eames put it in their famous
tongue-twisting credo. Plastics were the ideal medium

25 for that mission: malleable, relatively inexpensive, and
made for mass manufacture.

Yet, as in any new relationship, there were risks. It
was all too easy to exploit plastics’ powers of mimicry
to produce the kinds of imitations—pseudo-wood .cabi-

30 nets and faux-leather recliners—that contributed to the
growing reputation of plastic as an inferior material.
Plastics’ adaptability and glibness undermined their
capacity to achieve “dignity” as legitimate materials
worthy,of being taken seriously, one critic wrote.

35 This impression was exacerbated by people’s
unfortunate experiences with plastics in the immediate
postwar years. There were plastic plates that melted in
hot water, plastic toys that cracked on Christmas morn-
ing, plastic raincoats that grew clammy and fell apart in

40 the rain. Polymer technology improved during the
1950s as manufacturers figured out how to make better
plastics and, even more important, how to match the
tight polymer with the right application. But the
damage to plastic’s reputation had been done.

Passage B by Jeffrey L. Meikle
45 Worrying about the image of plastic made sense in
1945 when unfamiliar new materials confronted wary

consumers. By the mid-1950s, however, no one was
ignorant of plastic because it surrounded everyone.

ACT-A10

Sidney Gross, who joined Modern Plastics in 1952 and
50 became editor in 1968, recalled that he had “agitated a
lot” over the years to get SPI, the trade association for
the plastics industry, to quit trying to convince people
“that plastic is not bad.” It was a waste of money
because plastic’s image—good or bad—did not really
55 matter. The key to plastic’s success, as he saw it, was
. always “selling the manufacturer.” Once plastic prod-
ucts filled the stores, people had no choice but to con-
sume what they were offered. Most of the time, Gross
maintained, after the industry had solved postwar qual-
60 ity problems, plastic objects did work better. Things
made of plastic were better designed and lasted longer.
People intuitively recognized that fact even if they
retained an intellectual notion that plastic was bad or
shoddy. In short, nothing succeeded like success.

65 Often plastic did offer a significant improvement
on whatever it replaced. A sleepy householder had to
watch only once in disbelief as a polyethylene juice
pitcher bounced off the kitchen floor to begin accepting
plastic in a practical way no matter how strong the con-

70 ceptual disdain for it. Even plastic toys, despite the brit-
tle polystyrene items that broke on Christmas morning,
proved superior in many ways. A toy soldier of molded
polyethylene could not scratch the furniture as readily
as an old-fashioned lead soldier. Most’ people who

75 expressed negative attitudes about plastic used it
anyway without thinking about it, either because a par-
ticular use had proven itself or because an inexpensive
trouble-free alternative no longer existed. As House
Beautiful observed in 1955, “The news is not that plas-

80 tics exist, but [that] they have already been so assimi-
lJated into our lives.” The average person was
“conditioned to plastics.” They had penetrated so far
into the material fabric of everyday life that their pres-
ence could not be denied no matter how many people.

85 considered them second-rate substitutes or a sad com-
mentary on modern times.

Questions 11-14 ask about Passage A.

11. In the context of Passage A, the author uses the
description of a fountain pen (lines 15-16) most nearly
to:

A. lament the way that unique objects began to look
identical after the advent of streamlining.

B. critique designers for creating items that were
beautiful rather than functional.

C. illustrate how even everyday items could be
designed to appear modern.

D. exemplify the kind of item that remained largely
unaffected by new design trends.

14,

The main idea of the second paragraph (lines 17-26) is
that plastics:

F. appealed to a prevailing philosophy of providing
great design to many people for a low cost.
G. quickly became popular enough to inspire a

number of famous credos and advertising slogans.
H. created a challenge for designers, who were not
used to working with such a malleable material.
J. inspired an artistic movement whose members
prized mundane objects rather than beautiful ones.

According to Passage A, one reason for designers’
early interest in plastics was that:

A. the materials’ ability to be freely shaped encour-
aged inventiveness.

B. consumers’ demand for attractively designed items

was high.

a person creating everyday items out of plastics

was seen as a bold risk taker.

older materials like Bakelite were difficult to work

with.

It can reasonably be inferred from Passage A that
before the 1950s, plastics manufacturers had not yet
figured out:

F. how to mold plastics to create the impression of
streamlining.
which plastics were best suited to specific purposes.
|. whether consumers would buy everyday items
made of plastics.
whether designers would embrace working with
plastics.

Questions 15-17 ask about Passage B.

15.

In the context of Passage B, the statement “They had
penetrated so: far into the material fabric of everyday
life” (lines 82-83) most nearly refers to the way that
plastics came to be:

A. considered a symbol of increased consumerism.

B. preferred by most consumers to more conventional
materials. .

CC. perceived as a threat to traditional ways of life.

D. pervasive to the extent that they were integral to

people’s routines.

In Passage B, the primary purpose of the details about
the polyethylene juice pitcher (lines 66-70) is to:

F. describe an advertisement created by the plastic
industry in an attempt to improve plastic’s image.

G. show how people might be persuaded by plastic’s
durability despite disliking plastic in general.

H. demonstrate how dramatically plastic’s quality
improved between 1945 and the mid-1950s.

J. provide an example of the kinds of mishaps that

biased people against plastic.

Passage B most nearly suggests that compared to toys
made of traditional materials, toys made of plastic
were often:

A. more flexible and more detailed.

B. less costly and sturdier.

C. less durable but also less destructive.

D. more popular with kids but less popular with
parents.

Questions 18-20 ask about both passages.

18.

19,

20.

To support their claims about the public’s perception
of plastics during the time periods discussed in the
passages, both passage authors:

F,_ quote people who used or wrote about plastics.
G. analyze publications that promoted plastics.
H. define key concepts used to market plastics.

J. personify artwork or objects made of plastics.

Both passages suggest that one bias the public held in
the postwar years was that items made of plastic were:

A. unattractive in design.
B. unnervingly artificial.
C. expensive novelties.
D._ inferior substitutes.

Which of the following statements best compares the
ways the authors of Passage A and Passage B use
details about plastic toys on Christmas morning?

F. Passage A uses the toys as an example of good
design, while Passage B uses the toys as proof that
plastic items were superior to what they replaced.
Passage A uses the toys to illustrate plastic’s popu-
larity, while Passage B uses the toys to illustrate
the lack of practical plastic goods.

Both passages use the toys to show the variety of
plastic items produced during the postwar era.
Both passages use the toys as an example of early
problems with plastic’s quality.

Passage III

HUMANITIES: This passage Is adapted from the article “The
Myth of Gabriel Garcia Marquez: How the Colombian Writer
Really Changed Literature” by Michael Wood (©2009 by Wash-
ington Post.Newsweek Interactive Co. LLC).

Many years later, and many times over, the writer
Gabriel Garcia M4&rquez was to remember the day he
discovered how to set about writing his great novel. He
was driving from Mexico City to Acapulco when the
illumination hit him. He turned the car around, went
home, and locked himself away for 18 months. When
he reappeared, he had the manuscript of One Hundred
Years of Solitude in his hands.

a

When Gerald Martin, around the middle of his rich
and resourceful biography of Garcia Marquez, starts to
tell this story, the reader may be a little surprised, even
disappointed. “He had not been driving long that day
when . . . Garcia Marquez, as if in a trance, turned the
Opel around, and drove back in the direction of Mexico
City. And then...” Up to this point, Martin has not
been challenging what he calls his subject’s “mythoma-
nia”—how could he, since it’s the basis of the writer’s
art and fame—but he has not been retelling the myths,
either. He has been grounding them, laying out the
pieces of what became the puzzles. And that’s what
he’s doing here, too.

10

20

After “and then,” Martin writes in mock apology,
“Jt seems a pity to intervene in the story at this point
but the biographer feels constrained to point out that
there have been many versions of this'story . . . and that
the one just related cannot be true.” The truth was no
doubt less “miraculous,” to use Martin’s word. The
writer probably continued to Acapulco. He didn’t live
in total seclusion for 18 months. And Garcia Marquez
wasn’t starting a new book; he was reviving an old one.

25

30

What Garcia Marquez found was a way of telling
it. He would combine, as he frequently said, the narra-
tive tone of his grandmother with that of the author
Franz Kafka. She told fantastic stories as if they were
true, because for her, they were true. Kafka told them
that way because he was Kafka. After his moment of
illumination Garcfa Marquez came more and more to
look for (and often to find) the truth in the fantastic, to
pursue whatever truth was lurking in the nonliteral
40 reading of literally presented events.

Just because the miracle didn’t happen as the story
says it did doesn’t mean there wasn’t a miracle. One
Hundred Years of Solitude changed Garcia Marquez’s
life entirely, and it changed literature. When he got into
the car to set out for Acapulco, he was a gifted and
hardworking writer, certainly. When he got out of the
car, he was on his way to the Nobel Prize, which he
won in 1982.

over the years. These jokes are witty and complicated

have been quite different. One of his finest sentences,
written in an article in 1983, concerns a dream of the
life he might have Jed if he had stayed in his isolated
birthplace of Aracataca, Colombia. “I would not per-
haps be the same person I am now but maybe I would
have been something better; just a character in one of
the novels J would never have written.”

The term “mythomania” certainly covers Garcia
Marquez’s stories about his life and plenty of his jour-
nalism. But his fiction is different. It takes pieces of
already thoroughly mythified reality—there is scarcely
an extravagant incident in his novels and stories that
doesn’t have some sort of basis in specific, local fact or
legend—and finds the perfect, unforgettable literary
home for them. But Garcia Marquez neither copies nor
further mythifies these facts and legends. He honors
them, to borrow a well-placed word from Martin:

6

8

{O]ver the dark story of conquest and violence,
tragedy and failure, he laid the other side of the
continent, the carnival spirit, the music and the
art of the Latin American people, the ability to
honor life even in its darkest corners.

70

To honor life, I take Martin as saying, is to cele-
brate dignity, courage, and style wherever they are
found and in whatever forms they take. It is not to deny
darkness or even to believe it has its compensations,

7

a

Martin’s biography is itself rather a dark affair—
appropriately, since he is telling the life of a man whose
autobiography is an elaborate historical myth. In Garcia
Marquez's own accounts, his life is both hard and magi-
cal. But it’s never sad, and Martin evokes the sorrow
that must lurk in such a life. There is perhaps a slight
imbalance in Martin’s insistence on the writer’s sad-
ness, an excess of melancholy; but it’s a good correc-
tive to Garcia Marquez’s own joking cheerfulness and
elaborate ironies, and we can return to the master if we
get too depressed.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the essay
“Our Place in the Universe” by Alan Lightman (©2012 by
Harper's Magazine Foundation).

One measure of the progress of human civilization
is the increasing scale of our maps. A clay tablet dating
from about the twenty-fifth century B.C. found near
what is now the Iraqi city of Kirkuk depicts a river
valley with a plot of land labeled as being 354 iku
(about thirty acres) in size. In the earliest recorded cos-
mologies, such as the Babylonian Enuma Elish, from
around 1500 B.c., the oceans, the continents, and the
heavens were considered finite, but there were no scien-
10 tific estimates of their dimensions, The early Greeks,
including Homer, viewed Earth as a circular plane with
the ocean enveloping it and Greece at the center, but
there was no understanding of scale. In the early sixth
century B.C., the Greek philosopher Anaximander,

15 whom historians consider the first mapmaker, and his
student Anaximenes proposed that the stars were
attached to a giant crystalline sphere. But again there
was no estimate of its size.

oa

The first large object ever accurately measured
was Earth, accomplished in the third century B.c. by
Eratosthenes, a geographer who ran the Library of
Alexandria. From travelers, Eratosthenes had heard the
intriguing report that at noon on the summer solstice, in
the town of Syene, due south of Alexandria, the sun
casts no shadow at the bottom of a deep well. Evidently
the sun is directly overhead at that time and place.
(Before the invention of the clock, noon could be
defined at each place as the moment when the sun was
highest in the sky, whether that was exactly vertical or
30 not.) Eratosthenes knew that the sun was not overhead

at noon in Alexandria. In fact, it was tipped 7.2 degrees
from the vertical, or about one fiftieth of a circle—a
fact he could determine by measuring the length of the
shadow cast by a stick planted in the ground. That the
35 sun could be directly overhead in one place and not
another was due to the curvature of Earth. Eratosthenes
reasoned that if he knew the distance from Alexandria
to Syene, the full circumference of the planet must be
about fifty times that distance. Traders passing through
40 Alexandria told him that camels could make the trip to
Syene in about fifty days, and it was known that a
camel could cover one hundred stadia (almost eleven
and a half miles) in a day. So the ancient geographer
estimated that Syene and Alexandria were about
570 miles apart. Consequently, the complete circumfer-
ence of Earth he figured to be about 50 x 570 miles, or
28,500 miles. This number was within 15 percent of the
modern measurement, amazingly accurate considering
the imprecision of using camels as odometers.

50 As ingenious as they were, the ancient Greeks
were not able to calculate the size of our solar system.
That discovery had to wait for the invention of the tele-
scope, nearly two thousand years later. In 1672, the
French astronomer Jean Richer determined the distance

55 from Earth to Mars by measuring how much the posi-
tion of the latter shifted against the background of stars

ACT-A1O

from two different observation points on Earth. The two
points were Paris and Cayenne, French Guiana. Using
the distance to Mars, astronomers were also able to

60 compute the distance from Earth to the sun, approxi-
mately 100 million miles.

A few years later, Isaac Newton managed to esti-
mate the distance to the nearest stars. (Only someone as
accomplished as Newton could have been the first to

65 perform such a calculation and have it go almost unno-
ticed among his other achievements.) If one assumes
that the stars are similar objects to our sun, equal in
intrinsic luminosity, Newton asked, how far away
would our sun have to be in order to appear as faint as

70 nearby stars? Writing his computations in a spidery
script, with a quill dipped in the ink of oak galls,
Newton correctly concluded that the nearest stars are
about 100,000 times the distance from Earth to the sun,
about 10 trillion miles away. Newton’s calculation is

75 contained in a short section of his Principia titled
simply “On the distance of the stars.”

Newton’s estimate of the distance to nearby stars
was larger than any distance imagined before in human
history. Even today, nothing in our experience allows us

80 to relate to it. The fastest most of us have traveled is
about 500 miles per hour, the cruising speed of a jet. If
we set out for the nearest star beyond our solar system
at that speed, it would take us about 5 million years to
reach our destination. If we traveled in the fastest

85 rocket ship ever manufactured on Earth, the trip would
last 100,000 years, at least a thousand human life spans.

31. The overall organization of the passage is best
described as a:

A. chronological account of scientists’ attempts to
determine the distance of the stars from Earth.

B. series of historical examples explaining how
increasingly large distances were measured.

C. step-by-step explanation of the calculations used
to measure Earth’s circumference.

D. collection of anecdotes describing how maps of
the universe have changed over time.

F. list the distances and measurements that were
known when Eratosthenes made his calculations.

G. explain what led early geographers to conclude
that Earth was curved.

H. demonstrate how humans’ sense of their surround-
ings has expanded over time.

J. summarize contributions the ancient Greeks made

If a gum is added to water (such as the water in a food
product), the viscosity (resistance to flow) of the resulting
aqueous mixture ‘changes. Table | shows, for each of
4 gums (Gums W, X, Y, and Z), the viscosity, in centipoise
(cP), of a 1.0% by mass aqueous mixture of the gum at
3 temperatures and at 3 resting times. A resting time is a
period of time an aqueous mixture of a gum sits at rest just
after having been prepared.

Passage Il

Biodiesel (BD) is a renewable alternative to tradi-
tional petroleum diesel (PD). BD is. typically prepared by
reacting soybean oil with methanol in the presence of a cat-
alyst, forming compounds called fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMEs). In contrast, PD contains no FAMEs. The pres-
ence of FAMEs in BD causes BD to absorb infrared light
differently than does PD. This difference allows pure BD,
pure PD, and mixtures of BD and PD to be distinguished
by analyzing the absorbance of infrared light.

Students performed 3 studies in which they deter-
mined the infrared absorbance characteristics of pure BD,
pure PD, and mixtures of BD and PD.

Study 1

The students measured the absorbance, A, of a sample
of pure BD and a sample of pure PD at wavenumbers from
600 cm™ through 1,800 cm™'. The wavenumber corre-

. . . 1
sponding to a given wavelength is defined as ‘The wavelength’
where the wavelength is given in cm and the resulting
wavenumber is given in cm‘, They plotted the results for
each sample (see Figure 1).

11. Suppose that in Study 1 the students had measured the
absorbance at wavenumbers from 600 cm” through

Passage IV

Biological aging is the process by which the functions
within an animal cell gradually decline, causing the cell to
age. Four students each proposed an explanation for how
this process occurs.

Student 1

Biological aging is caused solely by the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) produced by cellular respiration.
ROS are molecules that damage the proteins and lipids in a
cell. A cell produces antioxidants, which eliminate ROS
before they cause cell damage. However, the amount of
antioxidants produced by a cell is always less than what is
needed to eliminate all the ROS produced by that cell.
Therefore, ROS damage accumulates in a cell, causing it to
age.

Student 2

Biological aging is caused solely by the formation of
cross-links (a type of chemical bond) between the proteins
in a cell, causing these proteins to form clumps. These
clumps accumulate in a cell, interfering with the cell’s
functions, causing it to age. Although ROS is damaging to
proteins and lipids, this damage never occurs in a cell
because the amount of antioxidants produced by a cell is
always greater than what is needed to eliminate all the ROS
produced by that cell.

Student 3

Biological aging is caused solely by the DNA damage
that results from cell exposure to certain environmental
agents. The extent of DNA damage caused by these agents
eventually exceeds the cell’s ability to repair this damage.
Therefore, DNA damage accumulates in a cell, causing it
to age. Although cells do produce ROS, ROS damage never
accumulates in a cell. While cross-linked proteins do form
clumps in a cell, these clumps never affect cell function.

Student 4

Biological aging is caused solely by the lipofuscin (a
brown pigment made of oxidized lipids) produced by cellu-
lar respiration. Lipofuscin forms clumps that accumulate in
a cell, interfering with the cell’s functions, causing it to
age. Although cells do produce ROS, ROS damage never
accumulates in a cell. Because protein cross-links are
short-lived, protein clumps never accumulate in a cell. The
extent of DNA damage that occurs in a cell never exceeds
the cell’s ability to repair that damage.

aging is caused by a substance produced by cellular
respiration?

F. Student 1 only

G. Students | and 4 only
H. Students 2 and 3 only
J. None of the students

21. Suppose it were determined that the rate of biological
aging in an animal cell is directly proportional to the
number of chemical bonds formed between the pro-
teins in that cell, This finding would be most consis-
tent with the explanation given by:

A. Student 1.
B. Student 2.
C. Student 3.
D. Student 4.

22. Based on Student 2’s explanation, the substances
present in cells that are most directly involved with bio-
logical aging are composed of what type of subunits?

F. Amino acids
G. Fatty acids
H. Monosaccharides
J. Nucleotides

23. Carnosine is a substance that prevents protein cross-
linking in animal cells. Which student would be most
likely to predict that the average concentration of

ported if which of the following observations were tions in human cells. Suppose it were determined that
made? human neurons grown in the presence of Compound X

age at the same rate as human neurons grown in the
absence of Compound X. This finding would weaken
the explanation(s) given by which of the students?

animal cells increases the rate at which those cells

age.

animal cells increases the rate at which those cells G. Student 3 only

age. H. Students 1 and 3 only

Passage V

In a lake, water leaches (dissolves out) soluble
organic compounds from decaying tree leaves, producing
dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOC is subsequently
removed from the water if it is adsorbed by (becomes
adhered to the surface of) clay mineral particles that are
suspended in the water. Three studies done at a lake exam-
ined DOC adsorption by 3 clay minerals—CM1, CM2, and
CM3—found in the lake’s sediment.

Green leaves were collected from 5 types of trees
around the lake (maple, oak, pine, magnolia, and rhodo-
dendron). A 5L volume of lake water was filtered to
remove all solid particles. The following procedures were
performed for each type of leaf: A 100 g sample of the
leaves was mixed with a 1 L volume of the filtered lake
water. The mixture was then placed in the dark for
10 weeks at 4°C while leaching occurred. At 10 weeks, the
mixture was filtered to remove all solid particles. The
resulting liquid (the leachate) was analyzed for DOC.

Study 1

The following procedures were performed for each
leachate: A 100 mL volume of the leachate was mixed with
10 g of CM1. The mixture was stirred continuously for
2 hr, then filtered to remove all solid particles. The result-
ing liquid (the filtrate) was analyzed for DOC. The percent
of the leachate DOC that had been adsorbed by CM1 was
calculated (see Figure 1).

Passage VI

Plant roots can respond to a stimulus. Response to
light is phototropism; response to gravity is gravitropism.
Growth toward a stimulus is a positive tropism; growth
away from a stimulus is a negative tropism.

For 2experiments with wild-type (WT) and
mutant (M) Arabidopsis seeds, nutrient agar was put into
each of 8 petri dishes (PD1—PD8).

Experiment 1

Six WT Arabidopsis seeds were placed in each of PD1
and PD2. Six M Arabidopsis seeds were placed in each of
PD3 and PD4. Then, PD1 and PD3 were placed in the dark
for 70 hr, and PD2 and PD4 were exposed to light from
above for 70 hr. Figure 1 shows the growth of the
hypocotyls (seedling stems) above the surface of the nutri-
ent agar and the growth of the radicles (seedling roots)
below the surface of the nutrient agar in each dish at 70 hr.

Experiment 2

Six WT Arabidopsis seeds were placed in each of PDS
and PD6. Six M Arabidopsis seeds were placed in each of
PD7 and PD8. Then, PD5—PD8 were exposed to light from
above for 70 hr. After 70 hr, each petri dish was turned 90°
such that each dish was vertical and the seedlings in each
dish were approximately horizontal (see Figure 2).

Figure 2

ACT-A10

Then, PDS and PD7 were exposed to light from above
for 25 hr while PD6 and PD8 were exposed to light from
below for 25 hr. At various times during the 25 br, the
downward curvature, in degrees (°), of the radicle (relative
to its starting position) of each seedling in each dish was
measured. The average downward curvature of the radicles
in each dish at each measurement time is shown in

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely
blank, do not calculate a Composite score.
