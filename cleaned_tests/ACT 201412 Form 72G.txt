Some types of wood were considered better suited to
——

Esther Copley writes, “No wood does so well as deal
[pine or fir] for an ironing board; the heat draws out

a stain from any other kind.”

Accustomed to their traditional boards, 1860s

Americans weren’t quick to adopt new, often mass-
produced, ironing boards. As a result, inventors began

to craft more specialized boards that weren’t so general.
eee

Patents emerged for newly designed ironing boards

intended exclusively for difficult-to-iron attire, like

bonnets.
[1] Of the numerous ironing board inventors,

of which there were many, Sarah Boone is credited by
10

the US Patent and Trademark Office, turning the tide

11
against homemade boards. [2] Boone, a former slave,
patented an ironing board that had a tapered end in 1892

12
so that anyone could iron a sleeve easily and quickly.

[3] Her board had collapsible legs and was reversible,
allowing the user to iron one side of a sleeve and then the
other without having to move the shirt at all. [4] Popular
for its efficiency and convenience, Boones’ invention

13

pushed the modern ironing board into the American

domestic mainstream while simultaneously obscuring

its long, homemade history.

PASSAGE II
Meriwether Lewis: Botanist by Request
[1]
In 1803, Meriwether Lewis,
private secretary to President Jefferson,

16
was commissioned by the president to lead

a newly formed Corps of Discovery and travel

west to the Pacific Ocean. [A] Lewis was expected

to record “with great pains and accuracy” the “growth
and vegetable production” of the country the Corps
passed through. Jefferson hoped the information

would provide a key to the agricultural and commercial

possibilities of the western territory.

Responsible Ecotourism
[1]
When ecotourism first became popular during the
1970s, people were excited by its goal touring natural

31
habitats while affecting them as little as possible. Taking

i

an ecotour, by definition, meaning minimizing the
32
environmental impact of the trip. It was inevitable,

therefore, that an increase in any sort of tourism in a
33

natural environment would impact those in some way.
[A] People throughout the world have had to confront
unintended consequences of the growing popularity of
ecotourism. Now, guides are striving to preserve the
original goal, of low-impact tours, of the natural world.

aa a

[2]

[B] Ecotourism guides in heavily visited locales must
take great care in monitoring their clients to minimize their
effect on the natural environment. When leading hiking
tours, for example, guides must be vigilant that groups

36
don’t trample native plants or disturb wild animals. [C]

[3]

Equally important, you need to be wise advisors
and diplomats for their clients. [D] For instance, when
helping travelers make lodging arrangements, guides
should recommend accommodations that comply with

environmentally sustainable practices, such as conserving
energy and water. Ecotourists have tended to seek out

natural beauty in remote locations, where there may

not have been an active tourist industry previously.

PASSAGE IV
Crossing an Icon
Shortly after its completion in 1883,
the recently completed Brooklyn Bridge was

46
dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World and became

a symbol both of American industry, of modernism, and
47

the rise of New York City. They want to cross the

bridge because it’s beautiful. And because it’s big. And

so they can say, “I did it.” As for me, a native New Yorker,
I recently walked across the Brooklyn Bridge for the first
time for the same reasons.

Stepping onto the elevated promenade that serves

as the bridge’s pedestrian walkway and bicycle path,
I began my trek to Brooklyn. Though Frank Sinatra

had sang about the bridge’s “lovely views from Heaven,”
49

my first view, consequently, was far from heavenly.

I began to enjoy the views, for example, as I walked

inched my way to the bridge’s midpoint. Beyond the
tourists in their floppy foam Statue of Liberty hats

stood the real statue in the harbor. Looking back toward
Manhattan, I could appreciate the tininess of the island,
a seventeenth-century city bearing the weight of a modern
superstructure.
“Watch out!” The warning cry of a speeding

cyclist brought my attention back to the promenade,

where I had edged into the bicyclists’ lane. Though

some tourists near the bridge’s second tower paused to take

Passage | 40 bandleaders and arrangers/composers like the Bossman
Himself.
PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel The
Magic Keys by Albert Murray (©2005 by Albert L. Murray). My impression of Taft Edison from the very Outset
was that his ambition was to create compositions baseq
on down-home sacred and secular music, includin
45 workaday chants and hollers, that would be Performed

When I finally told Taft Edison about the time | in concert halls by concert hall-type instrumental and

School of Music because he was the student who con-

awarded. I said, Man, nothing like that had ever crossed cuciest the school’s widely popular CaueEs marching

my mind before. I said, Man, when I left home for col-
lege my main musical involvement beyond listening

and dancing to it was humming and whistling it. But although there were also two student-led

dance bands on the campus at that time, I can’t remem-
55 ber having ever seen him playing with either of them.
Not that I ever got the impression that he disliked or
had no interest in that kind of music, or that his attitude
was one of condescension, as was the case of many
conservatory-oriented students at the time. Not at all.
60 Because when you saw him at socials and at benefit
dances, he was always up-to-date on all the latest steps.
And also when he stopped by the Mainstem Lounge,
where you used to listen to the late-night radio broad-
casts from such then famous nightspots as the Savoy
Ballroom and the Cotton Club in Harlem and the Grand
Terrace on the South Side of Chicago in those days, he
could identify as many bands and sidemen as instanta-
neously as any of the dance band musicians, record col-
lectors, and patent-leather avenue Sharpies as happened

| to be there at the time.

10 I said, Man, when Hortense Hightower told me
what she told me about Suggesting me as a stopgap
replacement when the Bossman Himself called and just
happened to mention in passing that Shag Phillips had
given notice, I couldn’t believe it. But she said, Don’t

15 worry about it because he doesn’t go around looking for
superstars. He makes his own. Not because it’s a game
or some kind of challenge to prove anything about his
ingenuity as some kind of mentor either. She said, He

Passage II

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Mutant Maps” by Peter Weiss (©2006 by Science Service).

The numerals 1623 stared out from the title page
of a rare Shakespeare book. Printed in a quaint type-
face, those digits left no mystery about the publication
date of that prized volume.

5 “People want to know when ideas were developed.
In the history of society in general, dates are impor-
tant,” says S. Blair Hedges of Pennsylvania State
University.

An unexpected inspiration from genetics recently

10 led Hedges—a biologist with a penchant for old books

and maps—to develop a new way to sleuth missing
dates for printed works.

His work indicates that the print quality declines
with the steady aging of the blocks and plates used in
15 the printing process, not with how often they are used,
as most specialists had suspected. As biologists calcu-
late species ages from the accumulation of genetic
mutations, or molecular clocks, Hedges employs a
“print clock.”
20 There were more than 3 million books printed on
hand-operated presses using woodblocks and copper-
plates from the 1400s to the mid-1800s, and many of
those books weren’t dated, Hedges notes.

About a year and a half ago, Hedges was examin-

25 ing copies of a 16th-century book of Caribbean-island

maps printed from woodblocks. Printers from this era

would often use the same woodblock or plate in each
subsequent edition of a book.

This book—known as Isolario by Benedetto

30 Bordone—appeared in four editions: three dated 1528,

1534, and 1547, and one without a date. For 200 years,

rare-book specialists have been debating when the
undated edition was printed.

As Hedges looked at the various editions, patterns

35 of defects in the maps caught his eye. He noticed gaps

here and there in the lines on the maps. “In the first edi-

tion, there were very few. The later-dated editions had

progressively more breaks.” Hedges recalls, “I thought
these line breaks are kind of like genetic mutations.”

In organisms, the genetic code changes haphaz-
ardly, or mutates, at random intervals as a result of
chemical reactions or other insults, and the resulting
mutations in DNA accumulate over time. Biologists can
calculate the average rate of mutation over millions of
45 years of evolutionary transformation. They can then use
that average to estimate when one species diverged

from others.

40

ACT-72G

32

As Hedges pored over the /solario, it occurred to
him that random defects in wood blocks—like £enetic
mutations—may also have accumulated over the year,
at a constant average rate. If so, then bibliographe,,
could exploit that rate to date documents relative 1
those with known publication dates.

50

Hedges knew that line breaks in old wood-block
prints resulted from cracks in the blocks’ raised ridges
which produce the lines. The underlying cause—the
drying of the wood—would have taken place Steadily
over time.

55

In prints made from copperplates, Hedges
observed a different pattern of change. Printmakers cre-
ated designs on copperplates by engraving them.
Hedges noticed that the lines of prints from a specific
plate are typically thinner in later editions than in ear-
lier ones, so the overall image in later editions appears
65 faded.

Hedges claims a steady process of corrosion as
copperplates sat in storage could account for the
observed decline in print quality. When the time came
to reuse a plate, the printer would have had to scrub and
polish its pitted surface. Because engraved grooves
narrow with depth, stripping off the top layers of the
plate’s surface would have made such grooves narrower
and, therefore, the lines of the prints thinner.

70

Hedges says that his tests so far support the print-
clock hypothesis. He found 23 copies of J/solario,
including all the editions, in rare-book libraries. He
then counted the number of line breaks in the 112 map
prints contained in each book. When he analyzed the
data, he found that a steady accumulation rate of line
breaks per year matched up with the publication dates
of the three successive dated editions.

75

80

He next turned to the undated copy of Jsolario.
That edition had more line breaks than any of the
others. Hedges calculated that it was published in Feb-

85 ruary 1565, plus or minus 16 months.

Conveniently, another characteristic of the undated
Isolario edition—a small, intricate pattern on its title
page, called the printer’s mark—gave Hedges an
independent way to estimate that date. He took advan-
tage of computerized-image-analysis methods that are
used by medical scientists. He applied them to high-
resolution digital images of printer’s marks from Iso-
lario and other dated books from the same Renaissance
printer. His second estimate for the undated Jsolario
95 was April 1565, plus or minus a year.

are supportive of further testing of Hedges’s
hypothesis.

G. Yes; they believe Hedges has misdated the edition,
although they themselves are unsure of a way to
determine the date.

Crawford (©2008 by The New York Times).

Passage A by Linda Hogan

I saw it first in early summer. It was a green ane
sleeping bud, raising itself toward the sun. Over t e
summer this sunflower grew into a plant of incredible
beauty, turning its face daily toward the sun in the most

5 subtle of ways, in community with rain, mineral, moun-
tain air, and sand.

HUMANITIES: Passage A i

I was an outsider. I only watched. I had a small
understanding, nothing more than a shallow observa-
tion of the flower, insects, and birds. But they knew

10 what to do, how to live. An old voice from somewhere,
gene or cell, told the plant how to evade the pull of
gravity and find its way upward, how to open.

There are other summons and calls. Once a cen-
tury, all of a certain kind of bamboo flower on the same
15 day. Whether they are in Malaysia or in a greenhouse in
Minnesota makes no difference, nor does the age or
size of the plant. They flower. Some current of an inner
language passes between them. They are all, somehow,
one plant, each with a share of communal knowledge.
20 John Hay, in The Immortal Wilderness, has writ-
ten: “There are occasions when you can hear the myste-
rious language of the Earth, in water, or coming
through the trees, emanating from the mosses, seeping
through the undercurrents of the soil, but you have to
25 be willing to wait and receive.”

Sometimes I hear it talking. Once, in the redwood
forest, I heard a beat, something like a drum or heart
coming from the ground and trees and wind. That
underground current stirred a kind of knowing inside

30 me, a kinship and longing, a dream barely remembered
that disappeared back to the body.

Tonight I walk. I am watching the sky. I think of
the people who came before me and how they knew the
placement of stars in the sky, watched the moving sun

35 long and hard enough to witness how a certain angle of
light touched a stone only once a year.

It’s winter and there is smoke from the fires. The
Square, lighted windows of houses are fogging over. It
is a world of elemental attention, of all things working
40 together, listening to what Speaks in the blood.

Passage B by Arlo Crawford

My parents are Organic farmers, but springtime
makes my mother sad and anxious. In the winter, the
duties are reasonable: the barn cats need food, and the

eggs have to be collected. But the first Sprouts are

Soon the season was over. Potatoes and parsnips
and rutabagas were stacked in the cellars. The fields
were burned over with frost. We decided to go to Peru
to have an adventure. When we got back, we realized
that all our pictures were of vegetables. Old men selling
huge sheaves of green grain. A woman digging cassava
root. Donkeys toting stiff bundles of sugar cane.

It’s hard, tiring, often demoralizing work to make
vegetables. When I was little, my mother would some-
times hide away in an old chicken coop at the bottom of
the yard to cry. As a farmer, you can pour so much into
the vegetables that you feel obsessively devoted to
them. Farming isn’t about communing with nature—it’s
just a job. But if you immerse yourself in that job and

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Flotsam Science” by Sid Perkins (©2007 by Science Service).

In January 1992, a freighter crossing the Pacific
ran into rough weather. As the ship heaved through the
storm-tossed seas, several cargo containers—including
one filled with tens of thousands of plastic tub toys—

5 came loose, fell overboard, and broke apart. Seven
months after the spill, the plastic ducks, beavers, tur-
tles, and frogs began washing up on beaches. Scientists
who track ocean currents were ecstatic.

Even today, members of the tub-toy armada occa-

10 sionally make landfall. The date and place of each of

the nearly 1,000 toys recovered to date provide a data

point, says Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a retired oceanographer

in Seattle. Most of the drifters have remained stuck in

the Pacific Subarctic Gyre, a set of deep-water and sur-

15 face currents spanning an area the size of the continen-

tal United States that generally flows counterclockwise
around the northern Pacific Ocean.

In most of the world, the dispersal of flotsam

(floating debris) isn’t of major interest to researchers.

20 But along the bustling trade routes that link eastern

Asia to North America, the stuff that drops off ships is

enabling scientists to fill in details of how the Pacific
Subarctic Gyre works.

The ocean is teeming with a variety of scientific
25 instruments. When measuring surface currents, how-
ever, these devices have their limitations. Probes
specifically designed to ride surface currents have sen-
sors which can quickly become obstructed by algae,
barnacles, and other organisms that thrive in the sunlit

30 portion of the ocean.

What’s more, probe batteries fail within months.
Generally, probes haven’t traveled more than 1,000 km
in that time, says Thomas C. Royer, an oceanographer
at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. That’s only

35 a small fraction of the path around the gyre.

“We’ve never had a good handle on how long it
takes [floating] objects to go around the gyre, or even if
they do,” Royer adds.

To map the currents and clock their speeds,

40 Ebbesmeyer, Royer, and their teammates circumvented
the disadvantages of modern electronic probes by
harnessing the power of floating junk. Because the
Pacific is crisscrossed by major trade routes, “there’s a
lot of stuff out there,” Ebbesmeyer notes. Many of
45 those items can be traced back to specific spills, and if
the lost objects are durable, they can drift in currents

for years.

The team’s oldest data points—and the most
ecofriendly—result from the eruption of Alaska’s
50 Mount Katmai on June 6, 1912. Some of the pumice
spewed by that volcano fell into the Gulf of Alaska. In

65

Results of computer simulations indicate that

floating objects can be swept along several paths in the

Pacific Subarctic Gyre. An item following the shortest

loop would make a circuit in just over 2 years, the
researchers estimate, and items taking the longest route
would make a lap every 3.6 years. The average trip
around the gyre took 3 years. This conclusion fits with
observed recoveries of items that came at intervals of
several years rather than being spread evenly through

time.

70

75

According to the simulations, current speeds in the
gyre range between 11 and 13 cm per second, or about
one-fifth the speed of a typical human swimmer.

80 Once the researchers came up with these answers,
they analyzed long-term records of water temperature
and salinity at various sites in the North Pacific. They
observed 3-year-long cycles in the data—“a pattern
nobody noticed until the ducks came along,” says
85 Royer.

Studying the dispersal patterns of flotsam is
“interesting and creative,” says Howard J. Freeland, an
oceanographer at the Institute of Ocean Sciences in
Sidney, British Columbia. However, he cautions, the
date of recovery of an item found on a beach may not
reflect when it actually washed ashore. Ebbesmeyer and
his colleagues “have good measurements, but I’m not
sure of what,” he notes.

31. Which of the following questions does the passage
NOT answer?

A. About how large of an area does the Pacific Sub-
arctic Gyre cover?

B. In addition to toys, what other types of cargo fell

Passage IV

Companies W-Z were suspected of diluting pure
(100%) honey before packaging it for sale. Students inves-
tigated each company’s product by using the process of
osmosis. During osmosis, HO flows across a semiperme-
able membrane (such as dialysis tubing) from a solution
having a lower solute concentration into one with a higher
solute concentration. Smaller molecules (such as H,O) can
pass through tiny pores in the dialysis tubing, but larger
molecules (such as sugars) cannot.

Experiment ]

Two mL of 100% honey was mixed with 8 mL of H,O
to form a 20% honey solution. A 40%, a 60%, and an
80% honey solution were also made. A sample of 1 of the
4 solutions, 100% honey, or pure H,O was added to each of
6 bags made of dialysis tubing. Air was pressed out of the
bags, the bags were sealed, and the initial mass of each bag
plus its contents was measured. Each bag was fully sub-
merged in a separate beaker of pure H,O at 25°C for 2 hr.
The bags were then removed and dried off, and the final
mass of each bag plus its contents was measured (see

Table 1).

Passage V

When an electrical current flows through a metal strip
in a magnetic field, a magnetic force is exerted on some
electrons in the strip. These electrons are pushed to an edge
of the Strip, making that edge negatively charged (see
Figure 1),

Current

Figure |

The opposite edge of the strip, which develops a shortage
of electrons, becomes Positively charged, and so a voltage,
Vy, develops between these 2 edges of the strip.

A physics class conducted 3 studies of this phenome-
non, called the Hall effect.

In each trial of the studies, an aluminum strip having a
thickness d was clamped to a ring stand. The 2 ends of the
strip were connected to an electrical circuit containing a
DC power supply, and the 2 edges of the strip were con-
nected to a voltmeter (see Figure 2).

Passage V!

_ A science teacher lights a new wax candle (which, if
left undisturbed, would burn for several hours) in her class-
room. She then shows her students a glass jar and asks
them to predict what will happen if she places the jar over
the lit candle, completely sealing off the candle from the
surrounding atmosphere (see figure).

Four students give their viewpoints about why the
candle burns and about what will happen to the burning
candle once it is under the jar.

Student ]

The candle’s flame results from a combustion reac-
tion. When the candle is lit, the flame that lights the candle
heats the candle, which causes the candle to give off fumes
of wax. The wax fumes act as a fuel that reacts with the O,
present in the air. The reaction gives off energy, which
heats the surrounding air, producing a flame. If the jar is
placed over the lit candle, the candle will soon stop burning
because the O, in the air under the jar will be quickly used

up.

ACT-72G

Student 2

Student | is correct except that the fuel reacts with the
N,, not with the O,, in the air.

Student 3

None of the components of air are involved in the
burning of the candle. When the candle is lit, the energy
from the flame causes the fuel (candle wax fumes) to spon.
taneously decompose. The heat from the decomposition
reaction causes the reaction to continue. Thus, if the jar js
placed over the lit candle, the candle will continue to burn
until all of the fuel is used up.

Student 4

When the candle is lit, the energy from the flame
causes the fuel (candle wax fumes) to spontaneously
decompose into a massless substance called heat. None of
the components of air chemically react with the fuel, but
the O, present in air is necessary for the sustained decom-
position reaction. The O, is needed because as the heat is
produced, the heat must be absorbed for the reaction to
continue, and QO, is the only component of air that absorbs
heat. When O, absorbs heat, the O, is not chemically
altered. If the jar is placed over the lit candle, the candle
will soon stop burning because the O, in the air under the
jar will quickly become saturated with heat.

28. Which of the students, if any, claim(s) that when the
jar is placed over the lit candle, the candle’s flame will
go out instantly?

F. Student 2 only

a depth of 0 m to a depth of 2.0 m ?

F. The grass plot at Site X
G. The shrub plot at Site X
H. The grass plot at Site Y
J. The shrub plot at Site Z

35. Suppose a fourth shrub plot in the study area received
an average annual precipitation of 750 mm. If that
shrub plot had been included in Study 1, its average
95% root mass depth would most likely have been:

A. less than 1.6 m.

B. between 1.6 m and 2.4 m.
C. between 2.4 m and 3.3 m.
D. greater than 3.3 m.

39. The most likely reason that the soil core sections were
dried before being passed through screens in Study 1
was to ensure which of the following?

36. Is the statement “Some shrub roots penetrated more
than 1.5 m down into the soil” consistent with the
results of Study 1 ?

F. No, because for all 3 sites, the average 95% root A. That no C remained in the soil
mass depth for shrubs was greater than 1.5 m. . That no N remained in the soil

G. No, because for all 3 sites, the average 95% root
mass depth for shrubs was less than 1.5 m.

H. Yes, because for all 3 sites, the average 95% root
mass depth for shrubs was greater than 1.5 m.

J. Yes, because for all 3 sites, the average 95% root
mass depth for shrubs was less than 1.5 m.

37. In Study 3, which of the 3 shrub plots, if any, had the

greatest N content, averaged over the top 2.0 m of soil?

The shrub plot at Site X
The shrub plot at Site Y
The shrub plot at Site Z
The averaged N contents were the same for all

3 shrub plots.

40. At each of the 3 sites, the grass plot and the shrub plot

were adjacent. This arrangement ensured that which of
the following variables could be assumed to be nearly
identical for both plots during the studies?

F. Content of the soil
G. N content of the soil
H. Dominant plant species
J. Climate

Explanation of Procedur
Scale Scores from

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
Off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely
