she knows and who she is. Mama respects her and is
jealous. Mama’s made her choices and they are dif-
ferent. She'd like to learn from the old people, live the
way we used to, but she wants it modern, too. Ama says
.10 it’s not about choices but about heart ‘and heart is what

a

Mama’s low on. Because of how Ama lives, she’s a’

woman both admired and ridiculed, sometimes by the
same people and in the same moment of time. What
she’s got is herself, and that’s all she has. She has no

15 lights or television or washing machine, but sometimes,
even so, I think she’s got more than the rest of us
because she believes in herself, in what shé does. It’s
the way she lives in this place.

Since the first time I was here, I’ve kept coming

20 back, but I come alone now. The first time I came was

when my uncles’ sent me to ask her.if they could cut

some trees nearby. I stood in front of her, a small girl,

but not as afraid of her as my uncles were. ‘Her eyes

were the color of rivér mud after the wash of a storm,

25 her neck too bony, her collarbone protruding. I stood

here with something like courage, on this very porch,
and asked hér about the trees. P :

She looked me. over like she was thinking all the
same things about me, then asked, “Which trees?”

30 I could smell fish frying behind her, in her house.

I pointed. “Those ones that are dying out: there.
‘We'll bring you back some of thé wood,” I said. “Uncle
Sonny says you could use some.”

“All right. Go ahead.” And that was all we said.

35 She turned and went-back to the fish dinner cooking on
the stove. She had-a screen door then. I had seen her
through the screen: And I saw her older'than she is. But
when I went back to help take the wood to her, she
invited me in and gave me a glass of sweet tea to’ drink.

40 I sat down with her at the table and we talked, and she
looked nice. then, her hair shiny and clean around: her
- shoulders, her eyes soft.

“You know my mother,” I said, taking in her hair,

her hands that looked small and old from hard work.

45 “She's your cousin.” And she said, “Yes, I do, and

you're nothing like her at all.” That was what won me
over to Ama. z

- After that, they told me not to be going out to her

. Place. But I come here anyway and I help her out and

50 no one says much to me about it. I bring her ice some-

times, or sugar for her tea, or other small things I pilfer

from my mother’s place, a can opener or strainer, per-

haps. My mama knows I come and help her out even
though she pretends she doesn’t.

55. Ama likes having me here. It’s better than being at
home. It’s like being part of the world. Some days we
go out and fish. Fishing has its lessons. It teaches me to
be still. And holding still is not something that comes

. easy to me. I’m learning from Ama how to survive and
60 be friends with this land, and this is a place where a girl
. can get lost and the swamps and trees would eat her
alive, It’s a dangerous place with dark corners. On the
days when Ama is silent, I learn from her stillness. It’s
not that she’s moody. It’s not an empty quiet, either,

65 the way it would be with some people. It’s a full silence
and’ like sitting with it and it’s a relief from the chatti-
ness of my sister and mom. I can’t say what I learn -
from it; there’s no words for it. Words are such noisy
things and silence is something yon have to listen to

70 and when you do, it takes you by the hand, it catches
hold of you. It tells you how to know things, like how
sounds travel, where a certain bird is calling from.

But my feelings about Ama‘are mixed, I admit.
Sometimes I love her, but there are times I don’t even -

_ 75 like her. J can’t account for these feelings, but I think it

has to do with how the world catches me up. It’s when
I’ve come from school I’m most likely to find her
homely and strange. I see her through the eyes of other
- people and what they’d think of her. Through their eyes

80 she looks wild and crazy. Still, I-always want to stay

with her. Maybe it’s because I am afraid of everything
and she’s afraid of nothing and I want to learn this from

. her. Foolish, my mama calls her fearlessness, and she’ -
says foolish people don’t last too long around here. But.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from “Companies
. in a Family Way" by Amy Saltzman, which appeared in U.S.
. News & World Report (@1997 by U.S. News and World Report
Inc). * ¥

This is the paradox of the American workplace:
Most companies now realize they must make conces-
sions to a world where both parents work, and an
increasing. number offer flextime [flexible working
hours], child care, and other programs to help
employees cope. But the same companies expect their
most ambitious and devoted workers to forgo such
options or to take advantage of them only in order to
spend more hours at the office. They adhere to a blue-
10 print for success drafted 40 years ago when men went

to work and women stayed home. In this conception,
work is firmly in the center and “personal life” is
squeezed into whatever space remains. .

o

At a handful of companies, however, an experi-
15 ment is underway that turns this formulation on its
head. Rather than appending “family friendly” pro-
grams to a traditional conception of office life, these
firms are redefining the nature of work itself, making
balanced lives for employees a central tenet around

20 which the rest of the company is designed.

Like most new philosophies, this one was born of
necessity. Studies show workers want more balanced
lives, and companies are wise to adapt if they want to
stay competitive. Most corporations start out offering

25 traditional job flexibility programs, but few employees
take advantage of them. Child care would seem a good
way to help workers handle family-responsibilities, but
in some cases it adds a new level of anxiety. With
emergency child care availablé, for example, an

30 employee can now come to work even when a child is
too ill for day care, secure in the knowledge that a.com-
plete stranger is tending the toddler. “We had t6 ask
ourselves if this is really the message we wanted to be

. sending employees—that work’ should come first no

35 matter what,” says Patricia Nazemetz, director of
human resource policies and practices at a large tech-
nology company.

A more radical solution seems in order, and a few

companies are finding it in a growing body of work by

40 academics, psychologists, and management gurus. That

work suggests that if businesses want to help people

achieve balanced lives while helping firms profit, the

answer is not to add more programs but to revamp fun-
damental notions about how people work.

45 Research supports the notion that the key to bal-
ancing work and family interests.is a well-designed job,
one where goals are clear and: where workers have con-
trol over how, when, and where they get their work
done. Underlying this is a recognition that employees

50 have personal lives that sometimes get complicated. In
a study conducted at a manufacturer of automotive
products known for its family-friendly policies,
researchers from the University of Chicago found that

workers whose jobs allowed them ‘autonomy and input
in decisions benefited most from the company’s work
and family programs. These employees reported that
the policies not only helped them balance work and
family demands but made them more committed to
their jobs: They submitted twice as many quality
improvement suggestions as workers who did not use
work-family benefits. If a job was designed poorly,
however, offering little autonomy or control, the bene-;.
fits were of little help. .

Not all jobs, of course, seem to invite such reform.
Factory shift workers have little choice but to Teport to
work at specific hours. As a result, they are rarely able
to take advantage of programs designed to give
employees more flexibility“in their lives.-But if the
work itself is designed in a less-structured way, with
both personal and business goals in mind, even shift
workers benefit. :

At one car manufacturing company, for example,
an unusual four-day, 10-hour-a-day workweek, with
Totating day and night shifts, offers workers more
options while allowing the company to keep the plant
operating six days a week, 20 hours a day, with min-
imal overtime. Workers get five consecutive days off at
the end of each three-week rotation. Because they don’t
need to use leave time for appointments, these
employees have fewer personal obligations that cut into
productivity. And because teams are responsible for
deciding how management’s goals will be met,
employees who need a day off can simply switch with
another team member when personal problems do arise.

Few companies, of course, have the luxury of cre-
ating a new work culture from scratch, as that company
did. But even well-established companies can learn
from the innovative auto manufacturer: When such
changes start at the top and are driven by business need,
they are likely to succeed. . .

This passage is best described as being:

A. an argument in support of making modem work-
places much more family friendly.

B. an analysis of how traditional workplace-models.
have served American businesses.

C. a thorough evaluation of the drawbacks of making
workplaces more family friendly.

abandoned job flexibility programs.

Passage Ill ,
HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted-from “When M.I.T.
Artist Shouts, His ‘Painting’ Listens,” an interview with
Professor John Maeda conducted by Claudia Dreifus that
appeared in the July 27, 1999, edition of The New York Times
(©1999 by The New York Timés).

Within the art world, Prof. John Maeda, 32, is an
anomaly—a prize-winning graphic designer and kinetic
artist with a fistful of engineering degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. -

5 From his base in M.1.T.’s Media Laboratory,
Professor Maeda uses the computer as a tool and
medium to create art that can be produced only digitally
and that has the specific look of the new technology.

One of his best-known pieces is 2 drawing called “Time.

: 10 Paint,” in which colors fly through space. Another
piece, “The Reactive Square,” is about squares that
change shape when a viewer shouts atthem.°

Q. Your last book, Design by Numbers, is an art book

that is also a manual for a new computer language that

15 you invented to help artists understand the guts of

computer design. Why create a whole new computer
“language?

A. One reason was that programming languages are
made for people to write programs—big ‘applications.
For someone just starting out making art on their com-
puters, they.don’t want this big truck of a system. They
just want a simple bicycle that they understand. So 1
- designed the visual equivalent of a simple bicycle.
Design by Numbers, D.B.N., was an attempt to demys-
25 tify the technology behind computer art, to show how
simple itis, and that péople can do it.

2

3

Q. When you are creating your own computer art
Pieces, do you ever use prepackaged drawing pro-
grams? 7

30 A. Oh, yes, all the time. There are all kinds of fine
touches that prepackaged software makes easy: I could
invent my own finishing system, but this is faster. Of
course, the basic ideas, I.create. -

The problem is that most people can’t just “finish”
35 things with this software: They have to use it to start
them, also. For much of recent history, people have cre-

ated with brush, ink, paper—the materials of art. Now _

that they have begun creating with software and com-

. puters, the styles that emerge are homogenéous because

40 the software is universal. Without being able to know

. how to program, you can’t break out of the tech-

nology—just like if. you don’t know how to use brush
and ink, you’re limited. oa .

For most people, this really isn’t a problem;. they

45 aren’t necessarily looking for anything new. But for’

people who are seeking the next step, the prepackaged
‘becomes an itnpossible barrier to break free from.

I make everything I do. Many people are surprised

that I don’t have a programmer making things for me.

50 And others are surprised that I don’t have an artist con-

. trolling me; telling me how to program. Because today,

people don’t realize that it is possible to think. and

create on the computer. Artists are used to thinking that
programming is very hard—impossible.

images... . . ws

because it was created digitally and it’s not digital art.
Because digital art starts with an understanding and

Q. What did studying in Japan teach you? .
. ‘
A. The most important thing was to not be embar-

rassed about who I was. I had always been embarrassed
about coming from a manual-labor family. In Japan, I

80 was studying conyentional art, and I used my hands all

the time. That made me feel in touch with my human
side, which I had lost when I came to M.LT.

Q. Does the new technology mean the end of art as
~ we know it? 4

85 A. Yes, it does, It represents a new. dimension to the
way art will be understood or perceived. :

It's a departure from appreciating a singular
moment. What that means is . . . the reason why we can
appreciate art is because most art has a single resting

~ 90 point: canvas. .

It's painted. It’s dtied. It aspires to be perfect. The
medium of the computer is continually shifting. It can
shift at will, in a microsecond. Or an hour. There’s no
limit on how it can be taught to change.

-describing:

A. the limitations placed upon traditional artists by
the mére existence of the computer.

B. his nostalgia for traditional artistic tools such as”

brushes and.ink.
C. his sense that people in general resent their
inability to create entirely original computer art.
the constraints prepackaged drawing software
imposes ‘on artists’ creativity. .

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Zinc—The Immune System's Missing Link?” by Michael
Janson, M.D., which appeared in Health and Nutrition Break-
throughs (©1997 by New Hope Communications).

To the general public, minerals are far less under-
stood or valued than vitamins, though both are equally
important to physiological functions. Among minerals
themselves, calcium, magnesium and iron receive a dis-
proportionate. amount of attention, even though other
minerals are equally necessary. Actually, all nutrients
work in concert in our tissues to keep us healthy. One
may well wonder, therefore, why some minerals .are
held in so much higher esteem than others. Well, cal-
cium’s popularity, for example, is due largely to adver-
tising by the dairy industry to underscore the

a

10

importance of milk, and iron is well known because its

deficiencies are so easy to detect. 0

Mineral nutrients can be found in varying quanti-
ties in both our ‘diets and our bodies. When they are
present in our bodies in large amounts (measured in
grams), they’re called major minerals and include cal-
cium, chlorine, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium,
sodium and sulfur. Those that occur in smaller quanti-
ties (measured in milligrams or micrograms) are called
trace minerals and include boron,’ chromium, cobalt,
* copper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium, silicon and

* zinc. Deficiencies of either major or trace minerals can ©

be as devastating .to one’s health as a Jack of other
better-known nutrients such as vitamins A, C, E and B
complex. E By

Though zinc gets little attention, it is critical to a
healthy body. Without it, more than 300 enzymes
including trypsin and alcohol dehydrogenase cannot
work properly, and physiological functions such as
digestion and alcohol metabolism break down. The
human body generally contains 1.4 g to 2.5 g of zinc.
Moch of this zinc is found in muscle and bone. It is also

30

present in skin, hair and nails, as well as in the retina of .

35 the eye.

One of zinc’s most essential roles is for the white
blood cells of the immune system, where it helps the
body fight off a range of viral infections—from strep
and influenza to the common cold. Some white blood
cells produce antibodies (humoral immunity), while
others are phagocytes that attack and destroy invaders,
thereby providing cellular immunity.

The thymus gland, located just ‘under the sternum,

controls some of our immune functions and is affected -

by the amount of zinc:in the body. For instance, the
thymus produces thymulin, a thymic peptide that is

responsible fot cell-mediated immunity. As we age, the _

thymus gland diminishes in function and size—from
nearly the same size as the heart in infants to almost
. 50

- ‘humans and.animals. Although long considered a
normal process, it appears related to zinc nutritional
status. A zinc supplement given to aging mice restored

killer cells support a variety of immune-system func-
tions such as destroying foreign cells, virally infected
cells and cancer cells. An in vitro study showed that
zinc increased the response of T-cells to all immune
stimuli by 100 percent. The authors concluded that
“treatment with zinc may have immunotherapeutic rele-
vance, particularly in the aged and stressed organism.” .

Zinc has been linked to the body’s ability to resist
viruses, especially respiratory infections. In a group of
malnourished children, supplementation with zinc sig-
nificantly reduced the incidence of cough, fever and

_ tespiratory secretions compared to placebo. However,

after supplementation ceased, the. symptoms retummed to
previous levels. In addition, two Italian doctors con-
cluded -that zinc deficiencies in elderly people may lead
to depression of both hormonal and cellular immunity
and a significant increase of susceptibility to infections.

Zinc deficiency is often the result of a poor diet—
it is one of the hallmarks of malnourishment.
Supplementing with zinc is quite safe—its only signifi-
cant side effect is lowered copper levels in the body tis-
sues, since the two minerals compete for absorption.
Considering zinc’s safety, people should consider
taking zinc supplements, especially as they age—being
stire to include copper in the proper balance. Most prac-
titioners who supplement their patients’ diets with zinc
also recommend taking copper at a ratio of 10 mg to.
15 mg zinc for-each milligram of copper.

Passage |

Frog eggs develop into tadpales, which then metamor-
phose into.adult frogs. Recently, reported observations of
frogs with morphological abnormalities (usually a missing
or malformed hind limb) have increased in many localities.
Four hypotlieses attempt to explain this increase.

* Hypothesis I

Tadpoles are commonly parasitized by trematodes,
flatworms that burrow into the tadpoles, causing cysts to
form. The presence of cysts during tadpole development
can cause morphological abnormalities in the adult frog.
Thus, increases in trematode populations most likely
account for the recent increase in morphological abnormal-
ities.

Hypothesis 2

Dué to industrial pollution, Earth’s ozone layer has
thinned. This process has led to an increase in the amount
of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching Earth’s surface. UV
radiation can directly cause abnormalities in frog eggs by
producing mutations in the DNA that controls frog devel-
opment. UV radiation can also indirectly cause abnormali-
ties in frog eggs by chemically transforming certain
pollutants into teratogens, chemicals that cause develop-
mental abnormalities.

Hypothesis 3.

Certain pesticides contain a class of compounds called
retinoids. Frogs naturally produce retinoids, but at high
concentrations, retinoids cause mutations in frog eggs.
These mutations later result in morphological abnormali-
ties. Many of these mutations affect genes that control hind
limb development. Thus, the recent increase in morpholog-
ical abnormalities is probably due to an increase ii
retinoids from pesticides. .

ACT-BIF

38°

Hypothesis 4 .

Tadpoles and frogs are prey for many aquatic preda-
tors, including fish, turtles, and wading-birds such as
herons. Predator attacks are not always completely suc-
cessful; many result in injured frogs and tadpoles. Perma-
nent injuries in tadpoles and frogs could later appear to be
developmental abnormalities. Thus, increases in predator
populations most likely account for the. recent increase in
morphological abnormalities.

1. Which 2 hypotheses argue that the recent increase in
morphological abnormalities in frogs is the result of
human activities? .

A. Hypotheses 1 and 4
B. Hypotheses 2 and 3 -
C. Hypotheses 2 and 4
D. Hypotheses 3 and 4

2. All 4 hypotheses propose that the factors causing mor-
phological abnormalities in frogs are present in the:

F._ pesticides used by farmers.

G. environment in which the frogs live.

H. UV radiation produced by the Sun. .

J. bodies of the organisms that prey on frogs.

Which 2 hypotheses propose that direct contact
between tadpoles and another organism results in mor-
phological abnormalities in frogs?

When a volatile liquid is in a closed container, the
. liquid at the surface is constantly evaporating (forming a.
vapor) and condensing (reforming a liquid). At equilibriam
(when the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensa-
tion) the pressure exerted by the vapor is called the vapor
pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
Students did the following experiments to study vapor:
pressures and boiling points. . .

Experiment I

A 5 mL sample of water was placed in a flask, then’
heated until it boiled. A 2-hole stopper containing tempera-
ture and pressure sensors was inserted into the flask. The
temperature of the liquid and its vapor pressure were
recorded by computer as the flask was cooled in an ice bath
to 0°C. The procedure was repeated using ethanol and

The total mechanical energy (TME) of an object is
defined as the sum of its potential energy (energy of posi-
tion; abbreviated PE) and its kinetic energy (energy of
motion, abbreviated KE). The object’s PE = mgh, where m
is its mass, h is its height above an arbitrary reference
point, and g is the acceleration due-to-gravity (9.8 m/sec’).
‘The object's KE = mv’/2, where v is its velocity.

When the object’s motion charges but the sum KE + PE
does not change, the TME is said to be conserved.

Figure 2

On this track, Positions W and Y were at the same altitude;
the altitude’ at Positions U, V, and Z was zero. The cart was
launched at Position U with a given KE, after which the
students’ did not interfere with the cart’s motion. The cart
had to have enough KE between Positions W and Y to pre-
vent the cart from falling away from the track.

(Note: The results of Experiment 2 are not provided; some

* of the questions will ask you to decide what those results

most likely were.)

30. In Experiment 2, suppose the students wanted to
directly determine the difference, if any, in the cart’s
TME at Positions U and Z. Which of the following

. Measurements should they have made?
EF. The height of Position X
G. The heights of Positions U and Z
HL. The speed of the cart at Position X
J. The speeds of the cart at Positions U and Z

/ ACT Writing Test Prompt

At some high schools, teachers have
considered allowing each student to choose
the books he or, she will read for English
class rather than requiring all students in

‘class to read the same. books. Some teachers

support such a policy because they think -
students. will greatly improve their reading ~

_ skills if they read books’ they find

interesting. Other teachers do not support
such a policy because they think that

” students will learn more by participating in

class discussion with others who have read
the same books. In your.-opinion, should
each individual student be allowed to choose.
the books he or she reads for English class?

In your essay, take a position on this
question: You may write about either one of

‘the two points of view given, or you may

present a different point of view on -this
question. Use specific reasons and examples

: to support-your position.

@ Note :
Your test booklet will have blank space for-you to plan your essay.

For this practice test, use scratch paper.

You 'may-wish fo remove pages 33-36 to respond tq this prompt.

TABLE 1

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain ©
' Seale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,

fread across to either outside column of.the table and circle the .

scale Score that corresponds to that raw score. As you deter-
mine your 'scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided on
the'right. The highest possible scale score for each test is 36.
The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four

scale scores. To. do this, add your four scale scores and divide ~

the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round
it off to the hearest whole number. (Round down any fraction
less than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or
more.) Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite

“score. The highest possible, Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
