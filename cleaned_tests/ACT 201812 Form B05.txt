ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
‘one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

In 1961, Williams, by then a renowned architect,
was hired to design a new 100-room motel. Situated
among larger Las Vegas hotels, the La Concha needed
to stand out. Williams was tasked with creating an
eye-catching design that would attract guests. He drew
inspiration from a Southern California architectural
trend known as Googie. [B]

[3]

Envisioning a motel that combined the
name La Concha (which translates to “shell”)
with the arched roofs typical of Googie architecture,

the lobby that Williams designed was meant to

é
appear, from a distance like a giant shell. On three
rr ne

of the ones, Williams designed twenty-eight-foot-high
—s

concrete arches that jutted out over the sidewalks. [C]

the octopus propelled the pill bottle back toward the jet
stream. The researchers at the aquarium realized the
octopus was doing something extraordinary: inventing
a version of pitch-and-catch.

In inventing this game, the

actions of the octopus were not based

on survival. The octopus simply wanted to

play. Evolutionary biologists believe play

could have an important role through animals
cognitive development. According to the Theory

of Flexibility, play, the theory says, teaches an

animal to modify its behaviors, helping the

animal prepare for unexpected situations.
Embracing this idea, researchers at Cincinnati’s

of silk, people were shocked as Garnerin and his

regarded as the first trial parachute jump. About

It was unclear whether the linen panels anchored to the
frame would catch enough air to ensure a jumper’s safe

landing. Leonardo himself never actually built his

parachute. [*]

[1] In 2000, British skydiver Adrian Nicholas decided
to test Leonardo’s design. [2] The finished parachute
weighed 187 pounds; about 172 pounds heavier than a
modern parachute. [3] He constructed the parachute
according to Leonardo’s plans, using only materials that
would have been available in fifteenth-century Milan.

His parachute was constructed with nylon and without

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
book Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific
Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants by Robin Wall
Kimmerer (©2013 by Robin Wall Kimmerer).

Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
green. “Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn’t have.” After
fifty years they still raise the question of how to
respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a
silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.

But I know that someone else has wondered these
same things. In our Creation stories the origin of straw-
berries is important. Skywoman’s beautiful daughter,
whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving
birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
strawberry is ode min, the heart berry. We recognize
them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.

Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
you through no action of your own, free, having moved
toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and
mystery—as with random acts of kindness, we do not
know their source.

Those fields of my childhood showered us with
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.

I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
omy, “goods and services” not purchased but received

as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
this field.

In our family, the presents we gave one another
were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
definition of a gift: something you made for someone
else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
says it was because we had no money for store-bought
presents. It didn’t seem like a hardship to me; it was
something special.

My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father's
Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
berry shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I’m sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.

In fact, he thought wild strawberry shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not

Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-

would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from The Air-
plane: How Ideas Gave Us Wings by Jay Spenser (©2008 by
Jay Spenser).

The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind-sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can place blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.

a

Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri-

10 cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a

wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe’s many

experimenters. If not for this situation, the French—

who felt they had invented flight because of the success

of the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloons in 1783—might

15 well have been first. If so, the airplane, like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.

What led Europe’s aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson's persuasive vision of

20 what aviation would be.

First published in the early 1840s, the engraved
illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than a half century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe’s
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
30 notions.

2!

a

The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did in
horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption

35 shaped how France’s early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.

Part of Henson’s paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse-

40 drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don’t tilt sideways, or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.

Henson’s vision told Europe’s early experimenters

that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to

45 side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this

never happened, some experimenters used strongly

upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-

righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft

fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to

50 prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that

Europe’s pioneers were terrified of banking, or drop-
ping a wing in flight.

‘ACT-B05

Another place where Henson’s Aerial Steam Car-

riage paradigm misled people was the vital issue of

55 controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does

not require constant active involvement on the driver’s

part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.

Consequently, Europe’s “early birds” were

60 remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all

one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft

whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing

this vehicle aloft, one would simply “drive” it around
the sky.

65 A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe’s first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His 14-bis was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn’t bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to
actually land where he had taken off.

7

3

Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-

set. They too had seen Henson’s artwork, but it didn’t

75 sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-

mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its

manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.

Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
80 tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What’s more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
85 mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
90 doesn’t stay on top of these things every minute, he’s in
for a spill.

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: Passage A is adapted from the biography Duke:
A Life of Duke Ellington by Terry Teachout (©2013 by Terry
Teachout). Passage B is adapted from the biography Il! Take
You There: Mavis Staples, The Staples Singers, and the
March Up Freedom's Highway by Greg Kot (©2014 by Greg
Kot).

Passage A by Terry Teachout

What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
“accumulation of personalities” was a loose, festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman’s band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds as a pointillist painter might place dots of
red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations (“With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create”). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did
like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, “My ear makes
my decision.” To him, no other ear mattered.

Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington’s working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: “Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect.” Sometimes he worked “on” his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet “on” his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
“to mold the music around the man,” and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
it.

Passage B by Greg Kot

In a six-member male gospel group calling them-

sexes, the, Trumpet; Jubilees, Pops was third lead,

singing mostly in a falsetto voice, and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became a chore, he turned to his family.

“One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn’t show up for rehearsal,”
Mavis says. “He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn’t have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started.”

Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.

“People always ask, ‘How do we get the sound we
have?’ And that came from my father—the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, ‘Now, Mavis go here,’
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was ‘Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.’”

Questions 21-24 ask about Passage A.

21.

In Passage A, the phrase “smoothly blended playing”
(line 5) most nearly describes:

A. the quality that Ellington elicited from a group of
dissimilar musicians.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Tales from the Pit” by Andrew Curry (©2014 by Smithsonian
Institution).

The Messel Pit, located in central Germany, is known for its
fossils of mammals from the Eocene epoch.

At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.

a

Still, that alone doesn’t explain why so many land
mammals—not to mention birds, bats and insects—per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One

10 theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their

15 thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.

The lake was so deep that oxygen didn’t circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and the algae and other
organic matter turned into oil shale.

Among the thousands of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
30 senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
35 they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. “They just
tried to stay out of the way,” says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so

40 it went for nearly 150 million years.

Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of

45 species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. “They really tried every-
thing—flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating,” says Lehmann. “From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us.”

‘ACT-B05

Might have, but in many cases didn’t. Messel’s
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly

55 familiar. In the visitor center, kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of Ailuravus macrurus looks like that of a

60 giant squirrel. It’s three feet long, including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature’s fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no
squirrel ancestor. It’s an evolutionary dead end;
Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than

65 37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.

Ailuravus’ resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
70 time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions—bushy tails, say, or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs—popping up in different species. “It’s like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms,” says Lehmann.

75 And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies—some successful, others not—adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-

80 tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse’s stomach—fossilized leaves and grape seeds—
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant

85 mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.

31. The main idea of the passage is that the Messel Pit is
significant primarily because it:

A. substantiates the theory that mammals appeared
200 million years ago.

B. features fossils of mammals and dinosaurs
interacting.

C. contains fossils that reveal how warm-blooded ani-
mals evolved.

D. has fossils of dinosaurs that have not been found
elsewhere.

32. The main purpose of the second paragraph (lines 7-16)
is to discuss:

F. potential explanations for the large number of
animal fossils in the lake.

G. conditions in the lake that led to the large number
of dinosaur fossils.

H. the toxic prehistoric plants that grew in or near the
lake.

J. feeding habits of mammals that lived near the lake.

Passage |

A reaction is at equilibrium when the rate of the for-
ward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At
equilibrium, the ratio of product concentration(s) to reac-
tant concentration(s) is the equilibrium constant, K.

Consider the following reaction at equilibrium:
X+Y=Z

For this reaction, K is given by:

- 4
K= xiv
The brackets ([{ ]) around the symbol for a substance indi-
cate the equilibrium concentration of the substance.

This reaction was studied in 10 trials. Trials 1-5 were
conducted at the same temperature (see Table 1), and
Trials 6-10 were conducted at different temperatures (see
Table 2).

Passage Il

Juvenile Callinectes sapidus (a species of crab) typi-
cally hide among Zostera marina (a species of sea grass) to
avoid detection by aquatic predators. Two experiments
examined how Z. marina population density and C. sapidus
body size affect the ability of juvenile C. sapidus to avoid
predation in a particular coastal area.

Experiment 1

Each of 200 small (4.5 mm wide) juvenile C. sapidus
was prepared for testing as follows: One end of a 1.0m
piece of nylon fishing line was tied around the middle of
the C. sapidus, and the knot was then securely attached to
the C. sapidus with cyanoacrylate (a strong waterproof
glue). The other end of the line was tied to its own metal
rod. After being prepared, the 200 C. sapidus were equally
divided into 4 groups (Groups 1-4).

Each rod associated with a Group | C. sapidus was
randomly placed within a 100 m’ plot having a Z. marina
population density of 0 shoots/m? (sand only, no plants).
Twenty-four hours later, the number of surviving Group |
C. sapidus was determined.

The procedure for Group 1 was repeated for
Groups 2-4, except that Group 2, Group3, and
Group 4 were placed in plots having a Z. marina popu-
lation density of 380 shoots/m?, 760 shoots/m?, and
1,600 shoots/m?, respectively.

The results are shown in Table 1.

Experiment 2

Each of 200 large (23.3 mm wide) juvenile C. sapidus
was prepared as in Experiment 1. After being prepared,
the C. sapidus were equally divided into 4 groups
(Groups 5-8). The procedures for Groups 1-4 were
repeated for Groups 5-8 (see Table 2).

distances in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2.
C. Experiment 2; sound waves had to travel shorter

H. remained constant.

J. varied, but with no general trend.

In calculating the value of s,, Student 1 needed to
include a factor of 2 in the numerator. However, Stu-
dent 2 did not include this factor because:

A. in Experiment 1, sound had to travel over the dis-
tance x twice, whereas in Experiment 2, sound had
to travel over the distance y once.

B. in Experiment 1, sound had to travel over the dis-
tance x once, whereas in Experiment 2, sound had
to travel over the distance y twice.

C. every value of x was at least 2 times every value
of y.

D. every value of x was less than 2 times every value
of y.

Overall, which student obtained the more accurate set

of s, data?

(Note: This question is concerned with the accuracy of
a data set, NOT the precision of a data set.)

F. Student 1, because the s, values in Table | are

spread over a larger range than are the s, values in

Table 2.

Student 1, because the s, values in Table 1 are

closer, on average, to the correct value of s, than

Passage V

Two scientists discussed the evolution of 3 animal
groups: crocodiles, nonavian dinosaurs (all dinosaurs
except modern birds), and modern birds. The scientists
characterized the animals in each group by their resting
metabolic rate, RMR (the rate at which an animal uses
caloric energy when at rest), and according to whether they
were poikilothermic (had body temperatures that varied
significantly) or homeothermic (had body temperatures that
remained relatively constant).

Scientist 1

Crocodiles and nonavian dinosaurs evolved from a
common ancestor that had a low RMR and was poikilother-
mic. Crocodiles retained these traits. However, nonavian
dinosaurs had a high RMR and were homeothermic.
Modern birds inherited these traits when the group first
evolved from nonavian dinosaurs, and both traits have been
retained by all modern birds.

The bones of nonavian dinosaurs had a porous struc-
ture, no growth rings, and extensive vascularization (chan-
nels containing blood vessels). Extensive vascularization,
which is also seen in modern birds, is evidence of an effi-
cient circulatory system and a high RMR. Efficient circula-
tion distributes heat evenly throughout the body. Thus,
nonavian dinosaurs were homeothermic and could have
survived in cold climates.

Scientist 2

Crocodiles and nonavian dinosaurs evolved from a
common ancestor that had a low RMR and was poikilother-
mic. Crocodiles retained these traits. Nonavian dinosaurs
also had a low RMR and were poikilothermic. In contrast,
modern birds have had a high RMR ever since the group
first evolved from nonavian dinosaurs. Modern birds only
became homeothermic after nonavian dinosaurs went
extinct 65 million years ago.

The bones of nonavian dinosaurs were dense and had
growth rings. Each of these features indicates a low RMR,
and neither is seen in the bones of modern birds. Nonavian
dinosaur bones also lacked extensive vascularization, sug-
gesting an inefficient circulatory system that would not
have been able to distribute heat evenly throughout the
body. Thus, nonavian dinosaurs were poikilothermic and
could not have survived in cold climates.

birds:

B. evolved from nonavian dinosaurs.

C. have always had a low RMR.

have growth rings in a crocodile or in a modern bird?

Passage VI

Biosorption is a process that uses certain biological
materials (biomass) to remove metal ions from a solution.
Three experiments were done to study the removal of the
chromium ion Cr™ from aqueous solutions using a biomass
composed of crushed shells of the fruit Litchi chinensis. In
each trial in each experiment, the following steps were
performed:

1. Ina flask, 1.0 g of fresh biomass was added to 100 mi.
of an aqueous solution having a particular pH and Cr’
concentration.

2. The flask was capped, and the contents were shaken for
a particular time at a particular temperature.

3. Periodically, shaking was stopped so that a 0.01 mL
sample could be removed from the flask. This sample
was analyzed to determine the percentage of cr*
remaining in the solution.

Experiment 1

In each of Trials 1-4, an aqueous solution with an ini-
tial Cr™ concentration of 100 mg/L was tested at a temper-
ature of 30°C. The pH was varied from trial to trial. The
results are shown in Figure 1.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
Tange of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. if the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.
