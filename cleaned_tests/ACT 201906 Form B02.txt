ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |
Eddie Sweat: A Groom’s Groom

In 1973 the three-year-old colt Secretariat won
each event of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing
(the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the
Belmont Stakes), a feat accomplished only eleven
times in the twentieth century. While many factors
contributed to Secretariat’s success—selective
breeding, top-notch trainers, and a skillful jockey,
to name a few—the expertise and diligent care of

the horse’s groom, Eddie Sweat, who deserves
rs

some of the credit.

Another key figure was Ron Turcotte, the
skillful jockey who rode Secretariat to victory
in the Triple Crown races.

Should the writer make this addition here?

F. Yes, because it concludes the paragraph with a
logical transition to the rest of the essay.

G. Yes, because it identifies the “skillful jockey’
mentioned in the preceding sentence.

H. No, because it detracts from the paragraph’s focus
on horses that have won the Triple Crown.
No, because it detracts from the paragraph’s pur-

_ The dating of Catlos’s garnets, as well as analysis of

indicates that they were not formed by a single collision,
as was previously thought. Rather, it seems that India has

Ports of Recall: Hudson River Ferries

The first steam-powered ferry on the Hudson River,
the Juliana, left Hoboken, New. Jersey, fot New York City
on October 11; 181 1, in the nineteenth century. Ferries,
mostly of the small sailboat kind called sloops, had been
traveling on the Hudson for centuries, carrying cargo and

passengers. What made steamboat travel so revolutionary

was speed. A trip from New York City to Albany, for

example, took seven days in a sloop, a steamboat

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This pagsage is adapted from The Tipping
Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm
Gladwell (©2002 by Malcolm Gladwell). :

There is a concept in cognitive psychology called
the channel capacity, which refers to the amount of
space in our brain for certain kinds of information. Sup-
pose, for example, that I played you a number of differ-
ent musical tones, at random, and asked you to identify
each one with a number. If I played you a really low
tone, you would call it one, and if I played you a
medium tone you would call ittwo, anda high tone you
would call three. The purpose of the test is to find out
how. long you can continue to distinguish among differ-
ent tones. Most people can divide tones into ofly.about
six different categories before they begin to make mis-
takes and start lumping different tones in the same cate-
gory. This is‘a. remarkably consistent finding: If, for
example, I played you five very high pitched tones,
you'd be able to, tell them apart..And if I played you
five yery low pitched tones, you’d.be able’ to tell them
apart. You'd think, then, that if I combined those high
and low tones and played them for you all at once,
you’d be able to divide them into ten categories. But
you won’t be able-to. Chances are you'll still be stuck
at about six categories.

As human beings, we can only handle so much
information at once. Once we pass a certain boundary,
we become overwhelmed. What I'm describing here is
an intellectual- capacity—our ability to process raw
information. But if you think about it, we clearly have a
channel capacity for feelings as well. .

Take a minute, for example, to make alist of all
the people whom you would consider yourself truly
close to. The average answer is.12 names. Those.names

“make-up what psychologists call our sympathy. group.

Why aren’t.groups:any larger? Partly it’s a question of
time. If you look at the names.on your sympathy list,
they are probably the people whom you devote the most
attention to.'If your list was twice as long, would you
still be as close’ to everyone? Probably not. To be some-

,» one’s friend requires a minimum investment of time.

More: than that, though, it takes emotional energy. At a
certain point, at somewhere between 10 and 15 people,
‘we begin to overload, just as we begin to overload when
we have to distinguish between too many tones.

Perhaps the most interesting natural limit, how-
ever, is. what might be called our social channel capac-
ity. The case for.a social capacity has been made, most
persuasively, by the British anthropologist. Robin
Dunbar. Dunbar begins with a simple observation. Pri-
amates—monkeys, chimps, baboons, humans—have the
biggest brains. of all mammals. More important, a spe-
cific part of the brain of humans and other primates—
the region known as the neocortex, which deals with
complex thought and reasoning—is, huge by mammal
standards, For years, scientists have argued back and
forth about why this is the case. One theory is that our

AcT-B02"!

brains evolved: because our primate ancestors began to
engage in more sophisticated food gathering: instead of
just eating grasses. and leaves they began eating fruit,
which takes more thinking power. You travel much far-
ther to find fruit than leaves, so you need to be able to
create mental maps. You have to worry. about ripeness.
You have to peel parts. away in order to eat the flesh of
. 4 fruit, ‘and so on. The problem with that theory is that
if you try to match up brain size. with eating, patterns . |
among primates, it doesn’t work: So what does corre-
late with brain size? The answer, Dunbar argues, is
group size. If you look at any.speciés of primate—at
every variety of monkey and ape—the larger their neo-
cortex is, the larger the average size of the groups they
live with.

Dunbar’s argument is that brains evolve, they get
bigger, in order to handle, the complexities of larger
* social groups. If you belong to a group of five people,
Dunbar points out,-you have to keep track of ten sepa-
rate relationships: your relationships with the four
others in-your circle and the six other two-way relation-
ships between the others. That’s what it means to know
everyone in the circle. You have to’ understand the.per-
sonal dynamics of the group. If you belong to a group «
of twenty people, however, there are now 190 two-way
relationships to.keep track of: 19 involving yourself and
171 involving the rest.of the group. Even.a relatively
small increase in the size of a group creates a signifi-
cant additional sovial and intellectual. burden. Humans
socialize‘in the: largest groups of. all-primates because

Passage Vv . : ‘

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted from the-aiticle
“Back to the Future” by J. Madeleine Nash (©2008 by J.
Madeleine Nash).

The Sand Creek Divide is a high point in
Wyoming’s Big Horn Basin. From it you can see the
emerald patchwork of irrigated sugar beet and malt
barley fields that hug the Big Horn ’River as well as the

5 jagged mountain ranges that define the edges of this
harsh mid-latitude desert.

But between 55 and 56 million years ago, says

Scott Wing, a paleo-botanist at the Smithsonian’s
Museum of Natural History, the Big Horn Basin was a

10 balniy, swampy Eden, teeming with flora and fauna that
“would be at’ home in today’s. coastal Carolinas. And
then, all ofa sudden, things got a whole lot warther. In

a geological eye blink—less than 10,000 years, some .

think-global mean temperatures” “shot up by. around
15 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Big Red, a sinuous ribbon of rose-colored
rock, is the most ‘Vivid marker of this exceptionally
torrid time—the Paleocene-Eocene Thérmai Maximum,
or PET, as most paleontologists call it: Even before it

20 had a name, the PETM was starting to fascinate Wing.
\For.some time, it had been clear to paleontologists
studying the evolution of mammals that the transition
between the Paleocene and the Eocene was marked by
“the kind of innovative burst that implies sweeping eco-
25 logical change. Yet no hint of such a change had
appeared j in any of the fossil leaves Wing had collected.
‘e.would stare at leaves frori.the Paleocene and leaves
from the Eocene, but see almost no diffefence between
_them. “It was getting to be annoying,” he recillls, °
30 The Paleocene is the geological epoch that started
65 million years ago. At the time, mammals were rather
simple, general-purpose creatures with few specializa-
tions. Then, barely 10 million years Jater, at the dawn
of the Eocene, the first. relatives of deer abruptly
35 appeat, along with the first primates and first horses.

“You can literally draw a line in the rock,” says

Philip Gingerich, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Uni-

versity of Michigan: “Above:it there are horses; below

it there aren't.” In fact, where Gingerich works—at

40 Polecat Bench, in the. northern sector of the Big Horn

Basin—you can actually. see the line, in the form of a

band of light gray sandstone. Oddly enough, many

fossil’ mammals commonly found. above this line,

including those first horses, were abnormally small.

45 Typically, Gingerich says, Eocene horses grew to the

size of modern-day cocker spaniels, but these horses
were “about the size of Siamese cats.”

In 1991, as Gingerich.and others were marveling

over the miniature mammals of Polecat Bench,

’ 60 oceanographers James Kennett and Lowell Stott inves-
tigated a major extinction of small, shelly creatures
that, during’ the late Paleocene, lived on. the sea floor

off the coast of Antarctica. This massive die-off, they
found, coincided with a steep rise.in deep-ocean tem-
peratures and a curious spike in atmospheric carbon,

Less than a year later, paleontologist ‘Paul Koch
and paleo-oceanographer James Zachos teamed up with
Gingerich to show that this geochemical. glitch had also
left its calling card-on land. The trio éstablished this
indirectly by measuring the carbon content of fossilized
teeth and nodules plucked from the Big Horn Basin’s
55.5-million-year-old rocks.

To Wing, it began to seem increasingly implausi-
ble that plant communities could have segued through
the PETM unaffected. Soin 1994, he started a methodi-
cal search for the fossils, returning ‘year after year to the
Big Horn Basin.

At first, he found just a smattering of leaves, too
few to suggest any pattern, Then, in 2005, at the end of
a long day, he slid his shovel into a grayish mound and
pulled out a tiny leaf: “I ‘knew immediately that this
was totally different from anything I'd:seen before.” -

From that one site, Wing went, on to extract more
than'2,000 leaf fossiis representing.30 different species.
Missing fromthe mix ‘are the, cypresses.and other
conifers that were so common during the Paleocene;
gone also are the distant cousins of broadleaf temperate
zone trees. In their place are the legumes, a family of
plants, shrubs and trees that thrive today in seasonally
dry tropical and’ subtropical areas.

“What you ‘see is almost a complete changeover
from what was growing here before,” Wing marvels.
“What this ‘means is ‘that you could have stood in this
one spot-in Wyoming, surrounded by a forest, and
everything would have looked pretty much the same for
millions of years. And then, over a few’ tens of thou-
sands of years, almost all the plants you’re familiar
with disappear and are replaced by plants you’ve never
seen before in your life.”

Within the passage, the discussion of Wing’s scientific
research primarily functions as:

A. an example of a study that resulted in the discov-
ety of the Big Red.

B. an illustration of the methods used to date geologi-
cal epochs.

C. acounterargument to current assumptions. about

“Carbon dioxide. (CO;) i is consumed. during ‘photosyn-
thesis and produced: during cellular. respiration:. Photo-
synthesis and cellular respiration can be summarized by
equations 1 and 2, respectively:

1) 6CO, +-6H,O + light energy > Calt0y +60,
2) C6H}205 + 60, > 6CO; + 6H;O + energy

When CO, dissolves ,in an aqueous solution, an acid is
formed. Thus, the pH of an aqueous solution is affected by
the concentration of CO, dissolved in the solution. A stu-
dent performed an experiment to determine how the pH of
an aqueous solution is affected by the addition to the solu-
tion of an organism that.is. undergoing both photosynthesis
and, cellular respiration, an organism that is undergoing
cellular respiration but not photosynthesis, or both such
organisms.
Experiment F ‘

“ The. student prepared a sterile aqueous solution con-

of elodea (a water plant), a snail, or. both to each of
Tubes 3-8, placed a cap on each of Tubes 1-8, and incu-
bated all 8 tubes, at 25°C for 24 hr. During the incubation,
each tube received either no light for 24 hr (dark treatment)
or constant light for 24 hr (light treatment). Table 2 lists,

The student had hypothesized that in the absence of
photosynthesis and cellular respiration, light would
break down the bromothymol blue in the solution
during the 24 hr incubation, causing the solution to
become yellow:-Are the results of the experiment con-
sistent with this hypothesis?

A. Yes; the solution in Tube 2 was yellow at the end

At the end of the 24 hr incubation, why was the’ color
of the bromothymol blue solution in Tube 7. different
fromthe color of the bromothymol blue solution in
Tube 8 ? In the absence of light, the elodea in Tube 7
could not undergo: ay

the.snail from Tube 6 and added 10 drops of a new
solution, causing the color of the bromothymol blue
solution in the tube to change to blue. Was the new
solution more likely acidic or basic? .

A. Acidic, because the pH of the bromothymol blue

Solution increased when the new solution: was

Suppose that an additional tube, Tube 9, had been

‘included in the experiment and that Tube’9 contained a

small fish, but no elddea or snail, and received the light
treatment. At the end of the 24 hr incubation, would
the color ‘of the bromothymol biue solution in Tube 9
more likely have been yellow or blue?

F. Yellow, because the fish would have undergone

Cables 1, 2, and 3, each with its own tensiometer (a device
used to measure tension), were joined with a single knot.
The free ends of Cables.1 and 2 were attached to an
L-shaped support, and a cylinder of mass M was suspended
from the free end of Cable 3, Cable 1 made an angle 6 with
the top of the support, and Cable 2 made a 90° angle with
the side of. the support. None of the cables stretched under
tension. The. tension forces acting on the knot, which was
in static equilibrium, are shown in Figure 2. :

Suppose that Cable 2 was attached to the L-shaped

- support using a'bracket that has a maximum tension

rating of 51 N (meaning that it is unsafe to assume that
the bracket can support forces greater than 51 N).

Based on the results of the experiments, ‘was it safe to’

use this bracket? -

A. Yes, because T, exceeded 51 N in one of the trials.

B. Yes, because T, did not exceed 51 N in any of the
trials.

C. No, because T, exceeded 51 N in one of the trials.

D. No, because T, did not exceed 51 N in any of the

trials.

Based on the results of Experiment 1, in order for the

‘Passage VI

In the Chryse Planitia area of Mars’s surface, numer-
ous winding channels are visible. The channels, some of
which are 100 km long, were formed more than 3 billion
years ago (bya). Two scientists discuss whether these chan-
nels were formed. d by liquid H,O or by liquid C02.

Scientist I

Unlike today, Mars was warm enough prior to 3 bya
for liquid HO to exist on the surface. Prior to the forma-
tion of the channels, a large volume of liquid H,O slowly
accumulated. in a basin within the Chryse Planitia. Once
the. volume- became great enough, the liquid H,O was
released suddenly from. the basin. The:.rapidly flowing
liquid H,O carried away rocks and soil, forming the:chan-
nels..On Earth, similar features called-outflow channels are
prodiced by the sudden release of a large volume, of liquid

: #0 from a basin.

Grey hematite (a mineral) i is abundant on Mars" '$ SUI-
face within the Chryse Planitia, On Earth, this mineral is
associated exclusively with liquid H;0. Even today, large
quantities of frozen H,0 are still present in Mars’s polar
regions.

Scientist 2

Before 3 bya, large volumes of CO, gas were present a
short distance below the surface in the Chryse Planitia.
Eventually, the subsurface pressure due to the weight of the
overlying rocks and soil became great enough to change
the CO, to a liquid. When a later major eVent:such as an
asteroid impact removed most of the overlying material,
the liquid CO, quickly moved up to and then along the, sur-
face. The rapidly flowing liquid CO, carried away rocks
and soil, forming the channels. On Earth, gases or liquids
that have been under pressure belowground are released to
the surface during some volcanic eruptions. These pyro-
clastic flows move'rapidly along the ground, forming chan-
nels by carrying away rocks and soil.

’ Since Mars’s formation, its average surface tempera-
ture has never been greater than —50°C. This has made it
impossible for a significant amount of liquid H,O to be
present on the surface. If any liquid H,O had been present
on Mars’s surface, it would have reacted with CO, to pro-
duce carbonate rock (a rock composed of carbonate miner-
als). No carbonate rock has been found on Mars.

34. Both scientists describe how a flowing liquid formed
the channels that are more than 3.billion years old. The
process described by each scientist is an example of:

F.. erosion.

G. faulting.

H. . plate tectonics.
J. volcanism.

35. A. study concluded that at all times before 3.bya, the
, temperature and ptessure conditions a short-distance
below Mars’s surface in the Chryse, Planitia would
have allowed liquid H,O:to exist but would not: have
allowed liquid CO, to exist. This finding is inconsis-
tent with the discussion(s) of which of the scientists, if
either?

A. Scientist 1 only
B. -Scientist 2 only

D.. Neither scientist

36. Consider Scientist 1’s and Scientist 2’s assertions
about the source of the liquid that formed the channels
in the Chryse Planitia. According to Scientist 1, was
the source on ‘the surface or below the surface; and

according to Scientist 2, was the source on the surface

or below the surface?

once it reached Mars’s’ surface, would: have evaporated
completely before it had flowed 2 km. Does this infor-
mation support or weaken the viewpoint of Scientist 2 ?

40.- Based on Scientist 2’s discussion, did the pressure ‘of
rock and soil: on subsurface CO, ‘have the effect of
increasing the average distance between CO, mole-
cules or of decreasing the average’ distance between
CO, molecules?

F.. Increasing the average distance, because CO,
changed from a liquid to a gas.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain

On each of the four tests on°which. you marked ‘any
responses, the total number of correct-responses ylelds a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For 8ach test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds. to that raw score. As you:
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses Is 1. .

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four.
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round It
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.

The highest possible Composite score is 36. The: lowest:

possible Composite score Is 1.
