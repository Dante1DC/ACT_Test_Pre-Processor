45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In the
right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

Take Me Outside to the Ball Game
My sons are fortunate to have grown up ina
city where major league baseball is played. When I

was a child, it was a five-lour, once-a-summer trek,

to the nearest major league ballpark. My sons have to
endure only the twenty-minute‘ride to the stadium
that we make five or six times a year. But I think

my experience needless to say was richer than

theirs. The stadium I remember had a natural

grass field and Seats piled up high and close

to the players so we could hear them mutter.

Second, the dome should go. While it’s true
that the dome blocks out rain, it also blocks out the sun

hermetically sealed, the players’ skins look sickly,
and the hit ball is in danger of banging a rafter. Finally,

The actors who perform in television commercials
are some of the most fortunate people in show business.

But their faces aren’t as well known as are most movie

As a result, the competition for roles in
commercials have been fierce. A casting company
will typically audition hundreds of people for one
or two roles. Each role requires a certain physical
type. So, while auditioning, performers tend to
possess the same general physical characteristics.

[3]

Although casting decisions are usually based on a

performer’s appearance, auditions are tension-filled and
abrupt. Large groups of business types or athletic types
or beach types assemble in a studio’s lobby. After a
seemingly endless wait, each performer takes a turn in
front of the camera. Meanwhile, the performer smiles,
states his or her name, and then leaves the room. The
entire screen test lasts abut forty-five seconds!

Performers in Hollywood and New York

43. Which of the following statements, if added here,
would best reinforce for the reader the main point

made in Paragraph 5?

A. Thus, for some actors in commercials, luck and
perseverance can lead to impressive compensation.

B. But, it really isn’t fair that only a few very lucky
actors get to appear in commercials.

C. Therefore, the financial rewards for appearing in
commercials are meager in comparison to the
efforts of those who perform in the commercials.

D. Hence, commercial actors typically earn huge
sums of money for working only two days.

Questions 44 and 45 ask about the preceding passage as a whole.

45. Suppose that the writer has been asked to write a brief
essay illustrating some of the advantages and disad-

Does this essay successfully fulfill the assignment?

A. Yes; the essay describes the frustrations of audi-
tions and the slim chances of getting work, but it
also mentions the rewards that can go to patient
and lucky actors.

B. Yes; the essay focuses on the grueling hours of
training actors must undergo to audition for com-
mercials, but it also explains that they get paid
very well for their work.

C. No; the essay portrays the life actors live as easy,
since they can work two days and earn $50,000 a

actors that audition for parts, and on how frus-
trating those auditions are.

Leading the Cherokee

According to Wilma P. Mankiller, whose job was
like running a large company. In 1993, she hada $78
million budget and 1,200 employees, and she answered
to 140,000 people. What will she do next? She was the
elected principal chief of the Cherokee Nation in
Oklahoma and the first woman in recorded history to
Jead a major North American Indian tribe.

In 1945, in Oklahoma, Mankiller (the-name stems

a8
from a Cherokee military title) was born. She spent

a
her teen years and her early adulthood in San Francisco.

In 1969, just outside the city, American Indian
demonstrators occupied Alcatraz Island to protest

the government’s treatment of American Indians.

The protesters didn’t like the way the government was

o
treating American Indians. Listening to the activists,

Mankiller realized that they were giving voice to
feelings that she herself had. Mankiller began raising
funds for the Alcatraz protestors and taking college
courses in sociology. Several years later, she returned
to Oklahoma with her two small daughters, determined

to change her people’s lives.

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from “A New
England Nun,” a short story by Mary Wilkins Freeman (©1979
by The New American Library, Inc.).

Louisa was slow and still in her movements; it
took her a long time to prepare her tea; but when ready
it was set forth with as much grace as if she had been a
veritable guest to her own self. The little square table
stood exactly in the centre of the kitchen, and was cov-
ered with a starched linen cloth whose border pattern of
flowers glistened. Louisa had a damask napkin on her
tea-tray, where were arranged a cut-glass tumbler full
of teaspoons, a silver cream-pitcher, a china sugar-
bowl, and one pink china cup and saucer. Louisa used
china every day—sofnething which none of her neigh-
bors did. They whispered about it among themselves.
Their daily tables were laid with common crockery,
their sets of best china stayed in the parlor closet, and
Louisa Ellis was no richér nor better bred than they.
Still she would use the china. She had for her supper a
glass dish full of sugared currants, a plate of little
cakes, and one of light white biscuits. Also a leaf or
two of lettuce, which she cut up daintily. Louisa was
very fond of lettuce, which she raised to perfection in
her little garden. She ate quite heartily, though in a del-
icate, pecking way; it seemed almost surprising that any
considerable bulk of the food should vanish.

After tea she filled a plate with nicely baked thin
25 corn-cakes, and carried them out into the back-yard.
“Caesar!” she called. “Caesar! Caesar!”

There was a little rush, and the clank of a chain,
and a large yellow-and-white dog appeared at the door
of his tiny hut, which was half hidden among the tall
grasses and flowers. Louisa patted him and gave him
the corn-cakes. Then she returned to the house and
washed the tea-things, polishing the china carefully... .
Louisa took off her green gingham apron, disclosing a
shorter one of pink and white print. She lighted her
lamp, and sat down again with her sewing.

In about half an hour Joe Dagget came. She heard
his heavy step on the walk, and rose and took off her
pink-and-white apron. Under that was still another—

white linen with a little cambric edging on the bottom;
that was Louisa’s company apron. She never wore it
without her calico sewing apron over it unless she had a
guest. She had barely folded the pink and white one
with methodical haste and laid it in a table-drawer
when the door opened and Joe Dagget entered.

He seemed to fill up the whole room. A little
yellow canary that had been asleep in his green cage at
the south window woke up and fluttered wildly, beating
his little yellow wings against the wires. He always did
so when Joe Dagget came into the room... .

She placed a chair for him, and they sat facing
each other, with the table between them. He sat bolt-
upright, toeing out his heavy feet squarely, glancing
with a good-humored uneasiness around the room. She
sat gently erect, folding her slender hands in her white-
linen lap.

“Been a pleasant day,” remarked Dagget.

“Real pleasant,” Louisa assented, softly. “Have
you been haying?” she asked, after a little while.

“Yes... . Pretty hot work.”. . .

Presently Dagget began fingering the books on the
table. There was a square red autograph album, and a
Young Lady’s Gift-Book which had belonged to
Louisa’s mother. He took them up one after the other
and opened them; then laid them down again, the album
on the Gift-Book.

Louisa kept eyeing them with mild uneasiness.
Finally she rose and changed the position of the books,
putting the album underneath. That was the way they
had been arranged in the first place.

Dagget gave an awkward little laugh. “Now what
difference did it make which book was on top?” said
he.

Louisa looked at him with a deprecating smile. “I
always keep them that way,” murmured she.

“You do beat everything,” said Dagget, trying to
laugh again. His large face was flushed.

He remained about an hour longer, then rose to
take leave. Going out, he stumbled over a rug, and
trying to recover himself, hit Louisa’s work-basket on
the table, and knocked it on the floor.

He looked at Louisa, then at the rolling spools; he
ducked himself awkwardly toward them, but she
stopped him. “Never mind,” said she; “I’ll pick them up
after you’re gone.”...

Louisa got a dust-pan and brush, and swept Joe
Dagget’s track carefully.

If he could have known it, it would have increased
his perplexity and uneasiness, although it would not
have disturbed his loyalty in the least... .

They were to be married in a month, after a sin-
gular courtship which had lasted for a matter of fifteen
years. For fourteen out of the fifteen years the two had
not once seen each other, and they had seldom
exchanged letters.

The first paragraph suggests that Louisa’s neighbors
consider her to be:

A. aclose friend.

B. someone to be emulated.
C. a bit odd and stuck‘up.
D. a rich eccentric.

It is reasonable to infer fram the passage that Joe trips
on Louisa’s rug because he is:

I. usually reckless and careless.
II. always clumsy and weak.
Ill. feeling uneasy at the moment.
F. Ionly
G. I only
H. Land ILonly
J. Iand Ill only

The evidence in the passage most strongly supports an
inference that when he is at Louisa’s house Joe pri-
marily feels:

A. uncomfortable.

B. amused.
C. happy.
D. annoyed.

It is reasonable to conclude from the sequence of
events narrated in the passage that Louisa tells Joe
she’ll pick up the spools after he leaves because she:

F. wants to reassure him that the mess is unimportant
to her.

G. is trying to get him to pay more attention to her.

H. blames herself for leaving the work-basket where
it could be knocked over.

J. fears that if he does it, he’ll only create more dis-
order.

the magazine Adbusters Quarterly (©1991 by Adbusters Media
Foundation).

Kermit the Frog should be proud. At long last
North America is learning what the famous amphibian
has lamented for years: It’s not easy being green.

The greening of our society has surpassed the
media trend phase, and has taken root in our culture as
a permanent imperative, an ongoing reality that will
affect every facet of our society.

When even corporate America takes (at least the
thetoric of) environmentalism to heart we can be confi-
dent that the movement has been firmly entrenched.
When a corporate juggernaut like Procter & Gamble
flies executives to a Victoria, B.C., city council
meeting to beg that their disposable diapers not be
banned from local landfills; and then offers to donate
$100,000 in seed money to the city’s composting pro-
gram, we can be certain that green will be around as
long as greenbacks.

But a disturbing pattern has developed within the
movement as it grows. The pattern goes like this: scien-
tists forecast a specific cataclysm (ozone depletion,
global warming, rampant deforestation); the mass
media disseminates the: information (inevitably over-
simplifying things); public reacts with shock and
demands answers; the media redoes the story with
household tips to prevent said cataclysm; corporate
sector and finally government present “friendly” (band-
aid) programs to slow down the inevitable; media drops
the subject; public relaxes; scientists announce a new
calamity . . . and the merry jig goes on.

There are many drawbacks to this sort of feedback
loop, not the least being that each successive crisis
brings us closer to a jaded, “quit crying wolf” attitude.
Our problem lies in the nature of reaction itself.
Because environmental problems are so often presented
in an air of crisis, we lose the opportunity to calmly
examine the source of the problems. When we do
explore the reasons behind ecological threats, we delve
no further than learning that, say, fluorocarbons from
aerosols deplete upper atmosphere ozone. Rarely, if
ever, do we face the fact that all these impending nat-
ural disasters stem from the same man-made source. All
our specific little solutions make us miss the point of
the problem as a whole. Virtuous consumption,
bringing home CFC-free deodorant spray in a
biodegradable plastic bag, diverts our attention from
the true source of our environmental woes—consump-
tion itself.

Our culture’s highest aim, some would argue our
only aim, is to grow, to consume. Industrial and com-
mercial growth are the measures of our nation’s
strength. Our work ethic has been so twisted and

mutated that even language reflects that our dearest
wish for ourselves is to grow, to be productive, and to
consume.

This has not always been the case. As social critic
Stuart Ewen recently noted, “Up until the 17th century,
‘consumption’ had a negative connotation, essentially
it’s about destruction.” Later, during the 17th and 18th
centuries, consumption gained a neutral sense in
describing the new marketplace economics. By the 20th
century consumerism and consumption were being
exalted.

“To be a consumer is what we are,” says Ewen.
“Consumption is the ideal we seek. Unfortunately, it is
still what it meant before the 17th century. A consump-
tion-based economy is an economy driven by waste . . .
and therefore constant buying and disposing of goods
starts clouding the environment, starts destroying the
ozone layer, starts filling the waters that sustain us with
garbage . . . making life on earth impossible. Then we
have to realize that consumption as a way of life has to
be thrown into question.”

But when our ancestors prayed and worked for
growth and productivity they didn’t have material gain
as their only aim. Growth could also be gained in spiri-
tual, educational and other realms. Somehow, some-
where, we lost sight of what success means and
fashioned in its place a glorious, shining future where
bigger is better, new is good, and old is to be replaced
as quickly as possible. I don’t think our forefathers and
mothers would be satisfied with our fifty varieties of
cereal, our traffic jams, our undisposable nuclear waste,
and our landfills full of disposable diapers. Impressed?
Yes. Horrified? Maybe. Satisfied? I doubt it. Even
without knowing of the ecological drawbacks, they
would probably say we are making pigs of ourselves:
wasting far more than we use; and using much, much
more than we need.

According to the passage, today’s society judges our
nation’s strength by which of the following criteria?

A. A stringent.work ethic

B. Individual political freedom

C. Neutral marketplace economies
D. Industrial and commercial growth

The passage suggests that environmentally conscious
behaviors like using biodegradable plastic bags and
CFC-free deodorant:

F. cannot change the face of American business

economy.

are superficial solutions to a much larger problem.
J. will eventually solve all our environmental problems.

Passage III

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from Audreen Buffalo's
article “Sweet Honey: A Cappella Activists,” which appeared in
Ms. magazine (©1993 by Lang Communications, Inc.).

In 1973, Bernice Johnson Reagon, vocal director
of the D.C. Black Repertory Theater, was urged by
members of the Washington, D.C.-based company to
organize a singing group. Sweet Honey in the Rock was
the happy result. Using the original instrument—the
human voice—aided only by shekere, tambourine, and
microphone, the ensemble has built a reputation as the
world’s premier female a cappella ensemble [a group
that sings without musical instruments accompanying
it).

In helping birth Sweet Honey, Reagon brought
sure knowledge of music’s informational and transfor-
mative power to the task. Her musical mission is rooted
in the rural southern church pastored by her father. “For
the first 11 years, our church had no piano, and I’m still
an a cappella singer. I grew up singing in the nine-
teenth-century congregational tradition—a style that
can be traced to Africa.”

In describing that tradition Reagon says:
“Spontaneity is one of the characteristics that mark
congregational singing. Singers create as they go along.
vAlthougitlealeedan introduces the song, there is no
solo tradition. Once the song is raised, the group joins
and the creation becomes collaborative. You must be
open to what will happen to the song and you in
performance.”

Reagon’s life continues to be informed by the
Georgia community into which she was born and her
early civil rights activism with the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She, Rutha Mae
Harris, Cordell Reagon, and Charles Neblett were
members of the SNCC Freedom Singers. Appearing at
hundreds of freedom rallies and mass meetings during
the early 1960s, they were the movement’s singing
newspaper—reporting and defining the actions and
issues from the civil rights war zones where they were
frequently arrested. In many ways her mission has not
changed.

Spirituality, consciousness-raising, social respon-
sibility, healing, and—most of all—love resonate at the
heart of Sweet Honey’s repertoire. Songs such as
“Patchwork Quilt,” “Are My Hands Clean?” and the
Grammy-nominated “Emergency,” address AIDS,
worker and environmental exploitation, and racism.

The first song Reagon taught the group was one
she’d never sung but remembered from her youth,
“Sweet Honey in the Rock.” “When I asked my father
about its meaning, he said it was a parable that referred
to a land where, when rocks were cracked, honey would
flow from them.” Reagon came to interpret this as a
metaphor for the legacy of African American women in
the United States. Within many African traditions rocks

‘ACT-56B-SAMPLE

are considered living spirits. “So too, sometimes, we,
black women, have had to have the standing power of

65 rocks and of mountains—cold and hard, strong and sta-
tionary. That quality has often obscured the fact that
inside the strength, partnering the sturdiness, we are as
honey. If our world is warm, honey flows and so do we.
If it is cold, stiff, and stays put—so do we.”

60 Reagon, Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade
Casel, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahlil, and
Carol Maillard are the women who currently compose
the musical collective. Over the years’ more than
20 singérs have been members of the group.

65 The group meets, in the ancient way of women,
communally. Each is aware of the others’ unique con-
tributions. Each serves as a master teacher in at least
one repertoire or singing style and apprentices in an
area covered by another member. They write, produce,

70 discuss points of view, and develop ideas for songs and
treatments.

The fluid communal spirit of the group is manifest
in every performance.

“People who respond so enthusiastically to Sweet
75 Honey hear their own inner echo. They hear their
names called, their thoughts confirmed,” says Reagon.

“After a Sweet Honey performance, people often
ask, ‘Why do I feel so good after hearing songs that
deal with issues I usually find paralyzing to think

80 about?’

“Life’s challenges are not supposed to paralyze
you, they’re supposed to help you discover who you
are. They’re the prod that moves you forward.

“The civil rights movement was the most won-

a5 derful thing I experienced in my life,” Reagon muses.

“Day by day, I found courage to be who I was. Finding

courage. Taking the risk. There was something about

doing things that I had always been warned would kill

or ruin you. Well, I did get suspended and I did go to

90 jail—things I had been told to avoid at all costs. But I

found that if you avoided everything that was a risk,

there would be many things you’d never know about
yourself.”

21. Reagon indicates that her experience in the civil rights
movement made her more:
A. resentful.
B.. serious.
C. confident.
D. social.

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from Richard
Monastersky's article ‘Deep-See Shrimp,” which was published
in Science News magazine (©1989 by Science Service, Inc.).

The term “jumbo shrimp” has always tickled
oxymoron-lovers. But scientists are chuckling at a
new morsel of shrimp humor—the name Rimicaris
exoculata.

a

In 1985, when researchers discovered these shrimp
swarming around deep-sea geysers of super-heated
water, they named the species exoculata, meaning
“without eyes.” It seemed a fair and accurate title for a
shrimp that lacked the eyestalks and corneas other
0 shrimp use for vision.

But marine biologist Cindy Van Dover from the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and her col-
leagues report that the eyeless R. exoculata does indeed
have eyes. For some reason, the forces of evolution

5 have granted this shrimp a pair of unusual visual organs
located on the animal’s back.

The story of R. exoculata’s eyes began in 1986
when Van Dover obtained some specimens of the
shrimp in order to study their diet.

20 While studying the contents of the shrimps’ stom-

2

A

achs, Van Dover began to focus on a strange patch
located on the backs‘of the animals. This patch was
hardly noticeable on the dead specimens that had been
fixed in preservatives or frozen for lab study. But in
videotapes of the live animals in their natural habitat,
taken from the deep submersible Alvin, the patches
were reflective. The submarine’s lights glinted off them
as car headlights might set a cat’s eyes aglow.

a

When Van Dover took a closer look at one of the
30 specimens, she saw that the reflective patches seen on
video were actually two lobe-shaped structures sitting
underneath a thin, transparent layer of carapace, or
shell-type material. A dissection showed that these
lobes hooked into the shrimp’s brain via a bundle of
neurons that looked suspiciously like an optic nerve.
She wondered: Could this. be an eye?

&

She asked biochemist Ete Z. Szuts at Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole to look for
characteristic visual molecules in the lobes. Meanwhile,

(0 bioengineer Steven C. Chamberlain, a specialist in the
structure of invertebrate eyes from Syracuse
University, examined the back organ to determine
whether it was actually organized like eyes.

Chamberlain was able to detail the anatomy of the

45 patch, but he could not pin down the function of this

A

novel structure. “I wasn’t willing to say it was a sen-
sory organ; it could have been a gland,” he says.
Ultimately, it would be up to Szuts’ lab to provide the
key piece of proof that the organ must be a pair of eyes.

Szuts was looking for a visual pigment known as
rhodopsin, which is the light-sensing molecule in all
known types of eyes. Rhodopsin molecules are the
switchboard in the eye, absorbing photons of visible
light and initiating a neurologic message to the brain.

At the start, Szuts did not expect to find any
rhodopsin when he ground up several of the organs for
analysis. An animal’s back just seemed to be the wrong
place to put a pair of eyes. After all, he thought, other
species of deep-sea shrimp have eyes in the normal
place.

Besides, even if the back patch turned out to be
two visual organs, other problems would seem to hinder
the detection of any pigment. Normally, biochemists
need concentrated extracts from some 50 to 100 shrimp
in order to detect any visual pigment molecules, says
Szuts. But the number of available R. exoculata was
limited, and he was dealing with extracts from 5 to
10 shrimp.

Szuts’ skepticism turned to surprise when he
found the “eyeless” shrimp did have rhodopsin. “It
turns out R. exoculata has a visual pigment, and it has it
in very large quantities—at the very least five times
more than the usual amount of pigment in other
shrimp,” he says. Because the bright lights of the sub-
mersible most likely damaged much of the pigment in
the collected shrimp, Szuts believes the pigment he
found must be only a small fraction of the amount the
animal truly possesses.

It doesn’t take a microscope to see some of
R. exoculata’s adaptations for sensing extremely weak
light. Perhaps the most striking feature about the eyes is
their size. Chamberlain believes they developed on the
animal’s back because that is the only spot where such
large organs would fit.

R. exoculata’s eyes have no lenses, so they cannot
see actual images of an object. Just about all they can
do is sense the strength and direction of a light source.
Yet while they seem limited by the standards of ani-
mals living in bright light, the strange eyes are particu-
larly well adapted for their dark environment.

As it is used in line 46, the word novel most nearly
means:

A. unfamiliar.

B._ book-like.

C. typical.
D. inadequate.

32. If R. exoculata’s patch functioned as a gland, rather
than as an eye, which of the following observations
would a researcher reasonably expect to find?

F. The patch would not be lobe-shaped.

G. R. exoculata would have eyestalks on its front.
H. The patch would not contain rhodopsin.

J. R. exoculata would have a larger optic nerve.

33. Which of the following statements most accurately
characterizes the primary significance of Szuts’s
research findings?

A. Szuts proved that the reflective patches of R. exoc-
ulata contain much more visual pigment than do
the eyes of most shrimp.

B. Szuts created the possibility that the reflective
patches of R. exoculata were glands rather than
sensory organs.

C. Szuts proved that the reflective patches of R. exoc-
ulata were adaptations for living near underwater
geysers.

D. Szuts demonstrated that the reflective patches of
R. exoculata were anatomically organized like
most shrimp’s eyes.

34, The passage indicates that Van Dover originally began

studying R. exoculata because she wanted to:

F. prove that they had eyes.

G. examine their refléctive patches.
H. study their natural habitat.

J. study their eating habits.

It may be reasonably inferred that the videotape taken
from the deep submersible Alvin was essential in the
discovery of R. exoculata’s eyes primarily because it:

A. allowed Van Dover to see the shrimp in their nat-
ural habitat.

B. alerted Van Dover to the existence of the reflec-
tive patches.

C. provided Van Dover with a clear picture of the two
lobe-shaped structures.

D. supplied Van Dover with an illustration of how
these shrimp use their unique vision.

36. It may be reasonably inferred from the passage that the

message initiated by rhodopsin is transmitted to the
brain through:

F. carapace.

G. reflective patches.
H. the optic nerve.
J. eyestalks.

According to the passage, what effect, if any, did the
limited number of available R. exoculata have on the
outcome of Szuts’s experiment?

A. It prevented him from determining conclusively
that the patches were sensory organs.

B. It hindered the detection of the presence of visual
pigments.

C. It had no effect, because each shrimp contained
large amounts of visual pigment.

D. It had no effect, because the patches from the
shrimp he used had not been damaged.

The passage suggests that, in his research of R. exocu-
lata, Chamberlain was unable to determine:

F. how many visual organs the patch contained.
G. whether the patch functioned as an eye.

H. whether the patch contained lenses.

J. how the anatomy of the patch was organized.

39. The main idea of lines 55-68 is that:

A. biochemists normally need concentrated extracts
from 50 to 100 shrimp.

B. for a variety of reasons, Szuts believed it unlikely
that he would detect rhodopsin in the patches.

C. to prove that the back patch functioned as an eye,
Szuts had to find eyestalks.

D. it seemed illogical to Szuts that eyes could be
located on a shrimp’s back.

It may be reasonably inferred from the passage that the
term “characteristic visual molecules” in line 39 refers
to:

F. eyestalks.

G. rhodopsin.

H. corneas.

J. reflective patches.

Passage |

Students debate 4 hypotheses regarding the Moon’s
origin, based on the following observations.

Observations

Observation 1 — Earth and the Moon have the same
proportions of various oxygen isotopes (forms of
oxygen).

Observation 2 — The same minerals that compose ter-
restrial lavas are also found in lunar lava specimens.

Observation 3 — The:Moon contains little or no water.
\ :

Observation 4 — Earth contains a much higher per-
centage of iron than does the Moon.

Observation 5 — Fossil records show that the length of
Earth’s day used to be shorter.

larities. The Moon and Earth probably formed within the
same cloud of gas and dust, when large clumps of gas and
dust in the cloud gravitationally attracted additional mate-
rials from the cloud. (The collapse of clouds of gas and
dust also results in the formation of stars.)

Hypothesis 4

The Moon most likely came from somewhere in the
solar system far from Earth. As the Moon approached
Earth, it was attracted more strongly by Earth’s gravita-
tional field. Although the Moon speeded up as it
approached Earth, it was not moving fast enough as it
passed Earth to escape Earth’s gravity. Consequently, it
entered into orbit around Earth.

1. According to Hypothesis 2, the origin of most of the
matter composing the Moon was most likely which of
the following objects?

A. A star far from the Sun

Observation 6 — Collisions between Mars and other a iota
objects have resulted in the ejection of material from D. The Sun

Mars’s surface. Some of the ejected material has
reached Earth.

Hypothesis I

All of the material that formed the Moon came from
Earth. The rate of Earth’s spin on its axis was high enough
at one time to eject material from Earth’s surface. This
material was unable to escape Earth’s gravity and went into
orbit around Earth, forming the Moon.

Hypothesis 2

The material that composes the Moon came mostly
from Earth’s surface. A large object from another part of
the solar system collided with Earth and threw the surface
material into orbit around Earth. Some of the differences in
composition between Earth and the Moon might be
accounted for by the composition of matter from the large
object.

Hypothesis 3

The Moon was never a part of Earth, because Earth’s
and the Moon’s chemical compositions have too few simi-

2. Supporters of Hypothesis 1 would most likely agree
that at the time the Moon formed, the rotation rate of
Earth on its axis was:

F. fewer than | rotation per year.

G. 100 rotations per year.

H. 365 rotations per year.

J. many more than 365 rotations per year.

»

Suppose that supporters of Hypothesis 2 suggested that
the Moon contained a significant amount of water
when it was first formed. Which of the following state-
ments about the Moon’s water content would be most
consistent with their suggestion?

A. The Moon’s water content decreased after the
Moon was-formed.

B. The Moon’s water content increased rapidly after
the Moon was formed.

C. The Moon’s water content increased slowly after
the Moon was formed.

D. The Moon’s water content was constant after the
Moon was formed.

A chemist performed 3 experiments to determine the
boiling points and freezing points of purified water (H,O)
and solutions of various types of solids dissolved in H,O.
Experiment 1

Fifty milliliters (mL) of H,O was heated in a beaker.
The temperature of the H,O was recorded every 2 minutes
(min) until it remained constant, indicating the boiling
point. The procedure was repeated with a solution of
5 grams (g) of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 50 mL of H,O
and with 10 g of NaCl in 50 mL of H,0. The results are

Heat flow is the escape of Earth’s interior heat
through the lithosphere (crust and upper mantle combined).
For a given thickness, high heat flow indicates a rapid tem-

According to a simplified model of the hydrogen
atom, an electron orbits a proton located at the center of
the atom. The electron can exist only in certain orbits, each
with a specific radius. When the electron jumps from one
orbit to another orbit of smaller radius, the atom emits a
packet of energy known as a photon.

The electron jumps shown in Figure 1, which involve
the first 6 orbits, result in the emission of 3 types of pho-
tons—ultraviolet, visible, and infrared. The energies and
wavelengths of the photons emitted due to these jumps are
shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Procedures Used to Obtain Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked
any responses, the total number of correct responses
yields a raw score. Use the table below to convert
your raw scores to scale scores. For each test, locate
and circle your raw score or the range of raw scores
that includes it in the table below. Then, read across
to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As
you determine your scale scores, enter them in the
blanks provided on the right. The highest possible
scale score for each test is 36. The lowest possible
scale score for any test on which you marked any
responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging
the four scale scores. To do this, add your four scale
scores and divide the sum by 4. If the resulting num-
ber ends in a fraction, round it off to the nearest whole
number. (Round down any fraction less than one-half;
round up any fraction that is one-half or more.) Enter
this number in the blank. This is your Composite
score. The highest possible Composite score is 36.
The lowest possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked
no items, do not list a scale score for that test. If any
test was completely blank, do not calculate a
Composite score. Now go to page 55 and use the

table to convert raw scores on the subscore areas to
scale subscores.
