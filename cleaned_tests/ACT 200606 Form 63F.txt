PROSE FICTION: This nassage is adapted from the novel
Chamber Music by Doris Grumbach (©1979 by Doris
Grumbach). The narrator, Caroline Maclaren, was married to a
well-known composer, Robert Maclaren. The Community refers
to an artists’ colony.

1 have decided to write this account because, long
as my life has been, it has given me no opportunity
before this to say what ] wish to put down here. Perhaps
the time was not right to do it before.

5 When I was young, and even into my middle
years, a scrim of silence surrounded what really hap-
pened in our lives. If there was talk, it was quiet con-
jecture about the indiscretions of our friends and
neighbors. Rumor and gossip were conveyed in whis-

10 pers. Secrets were surely no better kept than they are
now, but they lived quietly, under the breath. They
never appeared in public print or were reported by pro-
fessional gossips on the air waves. They were confined
to the inner coils of the private ear, a foot away, per-

15 -haps, no farther. We closeted our secrets, or forgot
them. This we called decorum, and we lived securely
under its warm protection

But now the Maclaren Foundation, which I headed
for so many years, alrnost fifty by now, wishes to have
a permanent record of Robert's life, and mine. Ours
together, to put it more exactly, and mine alone with the
Community, after hig death. The government has
become interested, they tel] me, in “the arts.” There is a
chance that, with its financia] help, in some place, the
25 Community. will be restored to life.

My initial reluctance to accede to their request is a
matter of personal habit, 1 suppose. ] am an old woman
born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with
all that decent age’s Jove of a calm surface to our soci-

30 ety. It was then the custom to have a regular, uniform
pattern to our lives, to present the historian with only
those facts which would contribute 1c an orderly
picture.

So ] am not equipped to write a confession in the

35 modern sense. Whether what | remember here wil] be
useful as a record to the new Foundation ] cannot say. |
am of an age not to care, almost ninety. My hearing is
defective, my bones seem to lie upon each other like

dry kindling, my skin falls away in slack little pinches
40 of flesh. ] am dry and brittle, 1 strain and break easily.
Rarely any more do J insert my two rows of teeth; few
persons bother to visit. .
I write this description of myself not because I
want pity—who pities the very old?—but to explain my
45 unaccustomed openness in this account." have nothing
to Jose that extreme old age has not already taken from
me, and no time to gain. The way the world thinks of.
me may well change, but even that, if it happens, J will
not survive.. The Foundation promises me that it will be
50 some time before the history of the founding of the
Community can be completely collated and that it has
no plans to publish it. I will not be here to witness the
astonishment of the reader, I am comforted by the real-
ization that there is no one T' know alive to be surprised
55 at me. . .

For the representation of truth, old age is a freeing
agent, No one should write of her life ‘until'all the wit-
nesses and acquaintances, family and lover’; are dead.
In addition, it helps to outlive the. mode of one’s time

60 until-it has changed beyond recognition. Then one is
left alone with what was. The wrinkled, spotted hand
writes of a time out of the memory of everyone alive
but itself. So what one tells is unavailablé to verifica-
tion or correction.

65 ] write this, then, because ] am freed by my sur-
viva} into extreme old age, and because I write in the
air of freer times. Whether this air is entirely salutary,
whether the old must of chests, of closets, bell jars, and
horsehair sofas is not a better climate for the storage of

70 the private life, 1 do not know. But I tire very quickly
these days and must speak openly, for once. ] am now
free. Extraordinary for me, and for one of my time, 1
intend to put down extraordinary truths.

1 rejected the offer to dictate to a secretary, decid-
75 ing I would celebrate my ninetieth year with e final

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article

"Farewell to Mr. Fix-It” by James Surowiecki (62001 by The
Condé Nast Publications inc.).

Ricardo Gomez runs an electronics-repair shop in
Brooklyn. He started in.the business fifteen years ago.
Today, he can fix just about anything, from tape-eating
VCRs to CD players with errant lasers, The one thing

be can’t fix is the fact that people don’t seem to get
things fixed anymore,

a

“Years ago, | had more work,” Gomez says. “But
today prices have come down so much for things like
TVs and VCRs that people would rather just buy 4 new

10 one than fix an old one. That also means that I can’t

charge that much for repairs. It’s a tough life, being a
technician.”

And it’s getting tougher. The shelves at the back of

Gomez’s shop hold rows.of TVs and VCRs with their

15 innards spilling out, but Gomez makes just a slim profit

on them. He charges around forty dollars to fix a VCR,

a bit more for a stereo or a TV. There are some things

he generally doesn’t bother with—-camcorders, some

brands of disc-players—because it costs-as much to buy

20 parts as it would to buy a replacement. But at least he’s

still in business. By some accounts, only a fifth of the

repair shops that were open fifteen years ago are around

today. Even the computer-service business is slow. In

the good old days, the repair trade was a business

where you were guaranteed a steady stream of cus-

tomers. Today, about all you're guaranteed is a long
Junch break.

2

R

That’s because the repair business is on the wrong
side of the most powerful trends in global manufactur-
ing of the past twenty years: the sharp rise in quality
and the steady decline in price. When it comes to most
manufactured goods, these are the good old days. Prod-
ucts are more reliable and more durable than ever. In.a
recent survey, Consumer Reports found that, in most
product categories, repair rates were between just ten
and twenty per cent.

Et

a

The average life of a car is up by nearly half since

1970. All this, and stuff often actually costs less. Your

run-of-the-mill VCR is forty per cent cheaper than it

40 was seven years ago. High quality, low price: for the
repair shop, it’s a deadly combination.

“You don’! find the Kinds of things you had
decades ago, like toasters that could electrocute you or
TVs that blew up,” David Heim, the managing editor of

45 Consumer Reports, says. “If you buy a TV, you're
going to get a good picture, and if you buy a stereo
you're going to get great sound. Jn fact, the guy who
used to test stereos for us told me that yeu cannot buy a
bad stereo, They don’t make the parts anymore.”

sumers in the history of the world—we expect our

machines to work. Nonetheless, we have a vestigial
memory of the days when they didn’t. How ¢lse to
explain the fact that, every year, people shell out mil-
lions of dollars on extended warranties that they seldom
get a chance to take advantage of? .

For manufacturers and retailers, warranties are
easy money. Service plans usually run just two or three
years and cover products that either will last much
longer or are easily replaced. The consumer pays up
front and rarely collects. You can see the results in the
quarterly reports for any major electronics retailer. A
big chunk of the 'profit margin comes from the sale of
extended warranties. Some retailers even cal] customers
months after a sale to offer repair plans and warranties.
Needless to say, they wouldn't make such offers if they
really believed that your TV was likely to go on the
fritz, But folks still bite. “People spend a lot of money
for a little extra peace of mind,” Heim says.

The lingering allure of warranties is understand-
able if you consider how recent the quality revolution
is. Before the nineteen-eighties, most American corpo-
rations saw quality as something that cost them a lot
and profited them little. They believed that it didn’t
play a big role in.a consumer’s decision to buy a prod-
uct, and that there was no way to make things both
better and cheaper. Japan’s success in the seventies
changed -that. Japanese companies, influenced by the
ideas of the quality-control guru W. Edwards Deming,
began winning market share by producing televisions,
cameras, cars, and VCRs that were vastly superior to
American products. Eventually, American companies
woke up and adopted Deming as a prophet.

The impact of the quality revolution Was immedi-
ate. The marketplace no longer tolerates shoddy prod-
ucts. Consumers have grown so accustomed to things
being ever cheaper and ever more reliable that compa-

nies have to keep driving cost down and quality up just
to stay in the game. an

In the context of lines 28-49, the statement “They
don’t make the parts anymore” (line 49) is used to sup-
port the idea that:

A. it is hard for repair-shop owners to find the parts
for electronic devices made before 1980.

B. no one knows as well as repair-shop owners how
long it takes to receive parts from manufacturers.

C. consumers are increasingly frustrated over prod-
ucts that have to be replaced rather than repaired
when they break down.

D. manufacturers are making products of a higher
quality and durability than ever before.

It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that
before the 1980s, the percentage of most categories of

American manufactured products that required repair
was: ‘

A. under 10 percent.

B. between 10 and 15 percent.
C. between 15 and 20 percent.
D. 20 percent or more.

Which of the following best expresses the paradox
described in the seventh paragraph (lines 50-56)?

F, Manufacturers are selling more products than ever
to American consumers but having to spend less
than ever on sales promotions.

Americans are spending more on repairs than ever
before and less than ever on adequate warranties.
Products are more reliable than ever, but Ameri-
cans are spending a great deal on extended
warranties.

American consumers are complaining more than
ever about the quality of manufactured products,
but products have never been more reliable.

According to the passage, the impact of extended war-
ranties on the financial status of American electronics
businesses is that the warranties account for a:

A. significant loss that is usually compensated for by
high sales of high-quality products.

small loss that is easily compensated for by sky-
rocketing sales of an increasingly varied range of
products.

companies.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted trom the essay “The

Mambo King" by Oscar Hijuelos (©2001 by The New York
Times).

In 1966, at the age of 15, I was a member of a rock
group in the South Bronx. We used to practice our
songs in the basement of an apartment building off
169th Street and Third Avenue.

& Once or twice a week I would saake the trip to the
Bronx from Manhattan with my father, and while, down
below, we youngsters pursued our nojsy musical educa-
tion, through buzzy amplifiers and $10 microphones,
the adults gathered upstairs in a third-floor apartment
and ate, talked and listened to music. On our breaks, we
would head upstairs to grab some food, and in that con-
genial atmosphere, we mixed with the adults, who
seemed amused,by our preoccupation with rock. While
we chatted and ate, their music played out of a stereo
* 45 console—Cuban chara:igas and sons, Puerto Rican
plenas and the music uf the great manibo orchestras,

led by the likes of Machito, Noro Morales, Mario

Bauz4 and the upstart bandleader, ‘already a star, Tito
Puente.

Fe

20 Of course, is teenagers smitten by American pap
culture, we sort of only half-listened to that music; we
consideréd Latin music archaic—the music of our
immigrant parents. It was the kind of music we had
been hearing every. day of our lives in the city, on the

25 streéts, in people’s living rooms, out of car radios.
“Time for something new”-is what went through our
heads, Latin music was so much a part of growing up in
New York that we, or at least I, took it for granted.
‘What was happening now, the music of the Beatles and

30 the Rolling Stones and so many others, was what we
aspired to. And-yet, on one of those afternoons when
our bandleader, breathlessly late for rehearsal, burst
into our dingy practicing room and announced: “Tito
Puente's playing a block party! Come on, let's go,” we

35 swarmed out behind him, anxious about missing some-
thing special.

The block party was up on East Fordham Road,
around Roosevelt High School. We arrived while the
band was performing one of Tito’s classics, “El

40 Cayuco” or “Oye Como Va” os “Ran Kan Kan.” A
crowd filled the street—vendors were selling hot dogs,
pasteles, chorizo sandwiches, sodas; women danced;
most of the men too, in T-shirts or guayaberas, weary
from their week of work but happy to be there. It was a

45 hot day, and we worked our way through all the people
toward the stage. There, on the plumber's-pipe plat-
form, were a trombonist, a saxophone player, a few
trumpeters, a pianist, a fellow banging the congas and
bongos, then a bassist, a man playing a standard dram

50 kit and Tito Puente himself, drumsticks in hand, poised
before the thin kettledrums that were his timbales,
beside the vibraphone on which he would also perform
the sublime “Hong Kong Mambo.”

observed Tito Puente carefully. There he was, perform-
ing regally, as if his working-class audience were kings
and queens, as if that street were the greatest venue in
all.of New York. He was already a legend, so much a

60 part of the history of New York and of Latin music (for

he had been a hallmark performer in the glory days of
the Palladium ballroom in the. 1950's) that it would
have been easy for him to slough the music.off. But he
played his heart out. He froze time, dissipated heat and

65 cheered hearts,

He went into jams—long, sustained mambo sec-
tions, during which his instrumentalists improvised—
and played his drums as if there were no tomorrow. He
sweated, dabbing his brow with a kerchief, and off-

70 handedly introduced his own formidable compositions

as if they were simply little tunes, That music flew
toward us like elongating barrels of mischief, like
singing angels, like mysterious sonic hicroglyphics, all
transmitted from some sacred musical place for our

75 amusement. From the time’ we arrived, he and bis band

played for another hour, and not once did he give the
impression that he wanted the party to be over. Most
beautifully, when the band had finished its last encore,
when: everybody, even the kids hanging off the

80. rooftops, were chanting “Tito!” he bowed to the audi-

ence, sent kisses flying and then began to walk off
stage. That's when our Jead singer, Santiago, who had
passed the concert jumping up and down in place,
scrambled toward him. He caught Tito’s ear with the

85 phrase “Soy borinquefo!”—~“I'm Puerto Rican”—and

Tito, nodding, called him aside and listened to
Santiago's story——19 years old and‘I want to be a great
musician like you--and what I, eavesdropping, heard
from Tito were the words, “I'll look out for you, kid.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the book
Wind by Jan DeBlieu (©1998 by Jan DeBlieu), Convection cur-
rents in the atmosphere, which are responsible for breezes,
begin when air is heated over warm land masses or seas and

then expands and rises. Thermals are columng ol rising warm
air.

No other class of animals lives so starkly at the
mercy of wind as the insects. In its benign, convective
form, wind plucks ap bugs by the millions, the trillions,
every day and scatters them widely. (This is not to say
they are dispersed at random. Biologists have often
seen insects choose a precise moment to set out—say,
just before the onset of a light rainstorm with west-
bearing winds—presumably so that they are most likely
to arrive in protected, food-rich habitat.) Once aloft
they depend on horizontal currents to ferry them

In 1926 Perry Glick, an entomologist in Louisiana,
made a series of flights in which he sampled the fauna

the wings of a small biplane. Few scientists had tried to
examine life at such heights, and Glick’s study is
regarded as a pioneering work, At 200 feet he found a
great number and diversity of insects. He caught by far

60 the most when wind velocities were between five and

eight miles an hour. Lesser winds seemed to discourage
insect flight; greater winds made it nearly impossible.

Above 300 feet the insect population rapidly
thinned. Nevertheless, Glick found a few spiders and

65 flies as high as 5,000 feet. He never devised'an accurate

means of measuring the flow of convection currents in
the atmosphere. But on days when the plane encoun-
tered turbulent air, he caught many more bugs at
3,000 feet, as if strong thermals had tossed them to

onward. Often they drift all night. In the atmosphere’s
upper Strata they encounter waves of turbuleace and
layers of different densities that sort and compress them
into compact swarms. They may drift as a unit through

Passage |

Transient luminous events (TLEs) are brief flashes of
light that appear above large thunderstorm clouds. A TLE
is produced by a positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning
stroke, However, not every +CG lightning stroke is fol-
lowed by a TLE. Figure 1 shows the typical shape, width,
and altitudes of 3 types of TLEs—ted sprites, blue jets, and
elves. Table 1 shows the typical duration (in milliseconds,

msec) and brightness (in kiloRayleighs, kR) of each type of -

TLE. Figure 2 shows the number of +CG lightning strokes
of a given peak electrical current (in kiloamperes, kA)
from 6 thunderstorms and the percent of those +CG Jight-
ning strokes that produced a TLE.

Soils are classified by texture (nature of the soil based
1 the proportions of sand, silt, and clay particles) and
oresity (percent of a soil's volume occupied by open
‘ace). Typical: soi] particle categories and their particle
ameters are shown in Table 1. A soil with particles that
ave a small range of different diameters is described as
ell sorted, whereas a soil with particles that have a wide
ange of different diameters is described as poorly sorted.

To grow on a medium (a nutrient system) that lacks
ginine (an amino acid), the bacterium E. coli must syn-
esize arginine from the medium. Figure 1 shows a por-
on of the reaction pathway for the synthesis of arginine in
. coli. Each of these reactions is catalyzed by an enzyme
@1-E4). In the first reaction, acetylornithine is the precur-
or, ornithine is the product, and El is the enzyme. In the
econd reaction, ornithine is the precursor, citrulline is the
sroduct, and E2 is the enzyme.

Table 1 lists the E. coli genes that normally code for
the enzymes in Figure 1.

Table 1
Gene | Enzyme
arg] El
arg2- E2
arg3 E3
arg4 E4

Sometimes a gene that normally codes for an enzyme
is damaged in such a way that the enzyme is not produced.
The pathway then shuts down at the reaction catalyzed by
that enzyme. As a result, the precursor increases in concen-
tration and the product is pot produced. An undamaged
gene is labeled with a pus sign (for example, arg"). A
damaged gene that cannot code for its enzyme is labeled
with a minus sign (for example, arg]”).

Experiment

A biologist grew wild-type (naturally occurring)
E. coli on minimal medium (MM), a medium that Jacks
arginine.

_To induce genetic damage, the biologist exposed wild-
type E. coli to radiation. She then identified those E. coli
that could no Jonger synthesize arginine from MM. She.
tested these E. coli on various media, Classifying them into
45 types depending on the media on which they grew (see
Table 2). . :

In Table 2, an “%” indicates that a given type could
grow on a given medium and thus could synthesize
arginine from that medium.

Passage VI

Polarity is a measure of the separation of charge in a
molecule, Molecules are attracted to other molecules based
on polarity. In liquid column chromatography, a mixture is
carried by the flow of solvent through a glass column cpn-
taining an adsorbent material. If the components of the
mixture have different polarities, they will interact differ-
ently with the solvent and adsorbent, causing the mixture
to separate into its components. When the components
elute (exit) from the column, they \ass through a detector
(see Figure 1).

=—~<—solvent

adsorbent

The following experiments were done to study how using
solvents and adsorbents of differing polarities affects the
separation of a mixture. A component's elution time is the
time it takes (from the start of the flow) for 100% of the
component to be eluted. Table 1 shows the relative polari-
ties (Q being nonpolar and 10 being extremely polar) of the
components of the mixture and of the solvents used.

Introduction

Students studying a unit op motion and conservation
of energy were given the following information:

° Kinetic energy (energy that changes as an object’s speed
changes) and gravitational’ potential energy (energy that
changes as an object’s altitude changes) are forms of
mechanical energy.

« An obdject’s total mechanicc! ‘energy is the sum of its
” kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy.

* If an object’s total mechanical energy is constant, its
total mechanical energy is said to be conserved.

* Friction causes some of an object’s total mechanical
energy to be lost, in which case its total mechanical
energy -is noz conserved.

The students’ teacher then described the following
experiment:

Suppose a student placed a block upon a surface
and gave the block a’single push. As the block
moved along the surface, the student measured
the block’s speed twice in succession and found
that the second measured speed was lower than
the first.

Given no other information, 3 students were asked to
explain the results of the 2 measurements and to predict the
block's motion after the 2 measurements.

Student IT

-The block wat moving on a rough, horizontal surface
(a surface witb no incline). There was a constant frictional
force between the block and the surface. This force alone
caused the block.to slow down at a constant rate and would
have caused the block eventually to stop. Once stopped, the
block would have reinained at rest.

Student 2
When the 2 measurements were made, the block was
moving up a frictionless, inclihed surface as shown in the
figure, and was slowing down at a constant rate, No air was
present.

incline

~<—- altitude of biock

Eventually, the block would have stopped moving up the
incline; then gravity alone would have caused the block 10
accelerate down the incline. At any specified altitude, the
block's spced going down the incline would have been the
same as its earlier speed going up the incline.

ACT-63F

Student 3

The block moved on a frictionless, horizontal surface. -
AS a result of its motion, the block encountered air resis-
tance. Air resistance alone caused the block to slow down
and lose mechanical energy. The rate at which the block
slowed down depended upon the amount of air resistance it
encountered. As the block’s speed decreased, the amount
of air resistance decreased.

34. Assume that the block was pushed and then released at
time = G. Student i’s description of the blotk’s-speed
over time after its release is best illustrated by which

35. The 3 explanations of the block’s motion are similar to
each other in that all 3 explanations;

A. contradicted the law of conservation of total
mechanical energy.

were based on 2 measurements,

were formulated using the assumption that no fric~
tion would exist between the block and the air.
were formulated using the assumption that there
would be no friction between the block and the
surface on which it moved.

36. Based on the explanations of the 3 students, what did
the 3 students most likely assume about the block’s
speed between the times the 2 mensurementa were
made?

FE The speed increased only.

G. The speed decreased only.

H. The speed increased, then decreased.

J, The speed changed, but with no general trend.

The teacher posed another question: Suppose, in a
second experiment, the student placed the block and
the surface in an airless chamber. Then the student
sepeated the procedure from the first experiment,
except that he measured the block’s speed throughout
the experiment. If the block’s speed remained constant
throughout this second experiment, the explanation(s)
of which student(s) for the results of the first experi-
ment would be best supported?

A. Student 1 only

B. Student 3 only

C. Students 1 and 2 only

D. Students 1 and 3 only

Based on Student 2’s explanation, the block’s gravita-

tional potential energy at the highest point on its path

most likely equaled:

BF. the block’s kinetic energy one-third of the way up
the incline.

G. the block’s gravitational potential energy two-thirds
of the way up the incline,

H. the block’s total mechanical energy.

J. zero.

7,

According to Student 1, while the block was moving,
did the block’s speed affect the frictional force on the
block?

A. Yes; as the block's speed increased, the frictional
force on the block decreased only.

B. Yes; as the dlock’s speed increased, the frictional
force.on the’ block increased, then decreased.

C. No; as the block's speetl decreased, the frictional
force on the block decreased, then increased.

D. No; as the block’s speed-decreased, the frictional
force on the block was unaffected.

Assuming that Student 1's ‘explanation i is correct, while
the block moved, was the total mechanical | energy of
the block conserved?

F. Yes, becanse the block’s kinetie ‘energy increased

and. its gravitational potential , enérgy remained
constant.

G. Yes, because both the block's, kinetic energy and
its gravitational potential energy increased.
HH. No, because the block’s kinetic energy decreased

and its gravitational potential energy remained
constant.

J. No, because both the block's kinetic energy and its
gravitational potential energy decreased.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
sponses, the total number of correct responses yinlds a raw
core. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
cores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
ange of raw scores that includes it in the table bclow. Then,
ead across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you deter-
Tine your scale scores, enter them Jn the blanks provided on

the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is 36.
The- lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composile score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends In a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Pound down any fraction less
than: one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.

, The highest possible Composiie score is 36, The lowest possi-
ble Composite score is 1.
