ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes —75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |
From Word-Cross to a Crossword Craze
In the early 1900s, the “Fun” section of the
New York World a Sunday supplement that presented
puzzles to enteitaia the newspaper’s readers.
One day, in 1913 the section’s editor Arthur Wynne,

2
was asked by his superior to create a new puzzle.

d by a game called “Magic Squares” from

his childhood, Wynne drew up a variation that used a
diamond-shaped grid with numbered squares in rows
and columns. The puzzle was to be filled in with the
answers to clues that corresponded to the numbered
squares. He named his new creation a “word-cross.”
After the puzzle’s debut in December. Requests
3

from readers came pouring in for more word-crosses.

Some readers even submitted puzzles of their own.

Wynne began including a word-cross in his section
every week. Usually one he wrote himself but sometimes
a reader’s gubnitesion. Eventually the puzzles became
known as “crosswords.”

By 1915, reader submissions arrived in such great

numbers that, Martha Petherbridge, Wynne’s secretary,
7

began assisting Wynne in managing and editing the

puzzles. Crossword devotees would complain if there

was even a small formatting flaw or factual error in
8

the puzzles, so Petherbridge checked carefully for
9
typographical and content errors prior to printing.

She also established firm rules for crossword layouts,
* including the introduction of square-shaped grids.
By the 1920s, the craze for crosswords
went far beyond the World’s “Fun” supplement.
Songwriters released tunes with crossword-related
lyrics. Fashionable women wore crossword-decorated

dresses. In line, fans of crosswords in crowds waited

10
at the New York Public Library to use
dictionaries to search for puzzle answers.
And a fledgling publishing company became

an immediate success when in 1924 it released a smash
tt

hit: the first book-length collection of crossword puzzles.

Alfred (Bud) Lane III didn’t grow up along the

coast of Oregon, which is where the Siletz Reservation

is located. He was born in 1957 in Guam, where his father

was stationed in the military. As a young adult, Lane

moved to the land of his ancestors to learn everything he

could about Siletz culture. The Confederated Tribes of the
”

Grande Ronde created Oregon’s first language-immersion

program to successfully teach the tribes’ preschoolers

to speak their native language, Chinuk Wawa. | 19 | He

learned fragments of the Coastal Athabaskan language,

as in small pieces of the language, but he longed to

16. At this point, the writer is considering adding the fol-
lowing true statement:

“Come here,” Lane is saying to the toddler.
Should the writer make this addition here?

F. Yes, because it helps explain why ghaa-yalh is one
of the easiest Coastal Athabaskan phrases to trans-
late into English.

G. Yes, because it provides a translation of the
Coastal Athabaskan phrase quoted earlier, a phrase
unfamiliar to most readers.

H. No, because it provides information that’s not rele-
vant to the paragraph’s focus on describing Lane’s
granddaughter.

J. No, because the essay later suggests that the
phrase Lane speaks to his granddaughter has sev-

A. Kept, because it provides information about
Chinuk Wawa. the language of the Confederated
Tribes of the Grande Ronde.

B. Kept, because it suggests that the Confederated
Tribes of Siletz Indians will be successful in
teaching their children Coastal Athabaskan.

C. Deleted, because it doesn’t provide information
that’s relevant to this paragraph’s focus on Lane’s
background.

D. Deleted, because it doesn’t state which member of

PASSAGE V
Paris: Where Apiary Meets Opera House
In the 1980s, during time off from a backstage
job in the world of Paris opera, Jean Paucton took a
beekeeping course at the famous Luxembourg Gardens.
Shortly thereafter, the prop expert ordered some. A

or
hive—securely packed, sealed, and humming with

life—arrived at Paucton’s workplace, the Palais Garnier is

a preeminent opera house in the city’s historic district.

[1] Paucton’s plans to establish the hive to his home in
@
the countryside fell through, and he found himself looking
for a place to temporarily store his purchase. [2] Up on the

roof, an opera house fireman suggested (who was raising

om
trout in the huge cistern below the Palais Garnier).

[3] Paucton’s bees have been cared for ever since, high
above elaborate productions of Carmen, La Bohéme, and
Cosi Fan Tutte. [4] Now in his late seventies, the beekeeper
has expanded his project to five hives. [5] The annual

harvest has grown to more than one thousand pounds

of honey, which he bottles, labels by hand, and sells

in nearby specialty shops. | 66

75. Suppose the writer’s primary purpose had been to
bring attention to a pressing environmental issue that
was solved through human ingenuity and perseverance.
Would this essay accomplish that purpose’?

A. Yes, because the essay establishes that Paucton has
persevered over many decades to reverse the deci-
mating trend of “colony collapse.”

Yes, because the essay proves that urban beekeep-
ers and their country cousins have rescued bees
from the effects of “colony collapse.”

No, because the essay does not claim that “colony
collapse” is a pressing issue in the global sense,
but rather a concern limited to beekeepers.

No, because the essay indicates that the problem
of “colony collapse” has not yet been solved,
though many are involved in seeking a solution.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Management Secrets of the Grateful Dead” by Joshua Green
(©2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group).

Since the 1970s, the Grateful Dead has invited
academic examination. Musicologists showed interest,
although the band’s sprawling repertoire and tendency
to improvise posed a significant challenge. Engineers
studied the band’s sophisticated sound system, radical
at the time but widely emulated today. Other disciplines
have also found relevant elements of the band’s history
and cultural impact to be worth examining.

o

Oddly enough, the Dead’s influence on the busi-

10 ness world may turn out to be a significant part of its

Jegacy. Without intending to—while intending, in fact,

to do just the opposite—the band pioneered ideas and

practices that were subsequently embraced by corporate

America. One was to focus intensely on its most loyal

15 fans. It established a telephone hotline to alert them to

its touring schedule ahead of any public announcement,

reserved for them some of the best seats in the house,

and capped the price of tickets, which the band distrib-

uted through its own mail-order house. If you lived in

20 New York and wanted to see a show in Seattle, you

didn’t have to travel there to get tickets—and you could

get really good tickets, without even camping out. “The

Dead were masters of creating and delivering superior

customer value,” Barry Barnes, a business professor at

25 Nova Southeastern University, in Florida, told me.

Treating customers well may sound like common sense.

But it represented a break from the top-down ethos of

many organizations in the 1960s and 1970s. Only in the

1980s, faced with competition from Japan, did Ameri-

30 can CEOs and management theorists widely adopt a
customer-first orientation.

As Barnes and other scholars note, the musicians
who constituted the Dead were anything but naive
about their business. They incorporated early on, and

35 established a board of directors (with a rotating CEO
position) consisting of the band, road crew, and other
members of the Dead organization. They founded a
profitable merchandising division and, peace and love
notwithstanding, did not hesitate to sue those who vio-

40 lated their copyrights. But they weren’t greedy, and
they adapted well. They famously permitted fans to
tape their shows, ceding a major revenue source in
potential record sales. According to Barnes, the deci-
sion was not entirely selfless: it reflected a shrewd

45 assessment that tape sharing would widen their audi-
ence, a ban would be unenforceable, and anyone
inclined to tape a show would probably spend money
elsewhere, such as on merchandise or tickets. The Dead
became one of the most profitable bands of all time.

50 It’s precisely this flexibility that Barnes believes
holds the greatest lesson for business—he calls it
“strategic improvisation.” It isn’t hard to spot a few of
its recent applications. Giving something away and
earning money on the periphery is becoming the blue-

ACT-T4H

55 print for more and more companies doing business on
the Internet. Today, everybody is intensely interested in
understanding how communities form across distances,
because that’s what happens online.

Much of the talk about “Internet business models”
60 presupposes that they are blindingly new and different.
But the connection between the Internet and the Dead’s
business model was made years ago by the band’s lyri-
cist, John Perry Barlow, who became an Internet guru.
In 1994, Barlow posited that in the information econ-
65 omy, “the best way to raise demand for your product is
to give it away.” As Barlow explained to me: “What
people today are beginning to realize is what became
obvious to us back then—the important correlation is
the one between familiarity and value, not scarcity and
70 value. Adam Smith taught that the scarcer you make
something, the more valuable it becomes. In the physi-
cal world, that works beautifully. But we couldn’t regu-
late [taping at] our shows, and you can’t online. The
Internet doesn’t behave that way. But here’s the thing:
75 if I give my song away to 20 people, and they give it to
20 people, pretty soon everybody knows me, and my
value as a creator is dramatically enhanced. That was
the value proposition with the Dead.” The Dead thrived
for decades, in good times and bad. In a recession,
80 Barnes says, strategic improvisation is more important
than ever. “If you’re going to survive an economic
downturn, you better be able to turn on a dime,” he
says. “The Dead were exemplars.” It can be only a
matter of time until Management Secrets of the Grateful
85 Dead or some similar title is flying off the shelves of
airport bookstores everywhere.

11. One main idea of the passage is that the Grateful Dead:

A. used an innovative, recession-proof approach to
business that other companies have learned from.

B. wouldn’t have become financially successful if
they hadn’t used the Internet for marketing.

C. displayed a talent for songwriting that few other
bands have matched.

D. organized the band in a way that mimicked the
structure of Japanese companies.

12. The passage most strongly implies that one way Grate-
ful Dead fans are similar to some Internet users is that
the fans:

F._ were willing to pay more for quality merchandise.
G. displayed a lack of generosity toward strangers.
H. formed communities across distances.

J. had diverse musical tastes.

Barlow most likely in order to:

A. illustrate that business leaders have implemented
the Grateful Dead’s methods.

instructive than that of other bands.

verify that the Grateful Dead were extremely naive
about running a business.

B.
Cc
D.

The passage indicates that one component of the
Grateful Dead’s business model was that the band:

F. increased its fan base by giving away tickets and

merchandise at performances.

G. discovered that a fan given something for free
would buy other merchandise.

H. appointed one member as CEO to streamline deci-
sion making.

J. resisted significant change because being consis-
tent produced financial stability.

What connection does Barlow make between the Grate-

ful Dead’s business model and Smith’s teachings?

A. By delaying the release of its music, the Grateful
Dead illustrated Smith’s teaching that scarcity
decreases profits.

By successfully marketing its music on the Inter-
net, the Grateful Dead disproved Smith’s teaching
that new markets should be entered cautiously.

By running its own company, the Grateful Dead
exemplified Smith’s teaching that controlling the
image of a brand adds value,

By choosing to allow fans to share copies of its
songs, the Grateful Dead acted counter to Smith’s
teaching that scarcity increases value.

B.

The main point of the first paragraph is that various
scholars have studied the Grateful Dead because:

F. few bands have produced such an extensive cata-
log of music.

G. the band’s fans found ways to make the band rele-
vant to their own careers.

the band displayed rare qualities in a number of
different areas.

the band’s traditional approach to music made its
members attractive subjects.

G. How did the Grateful Dead maintain contact with
its fans?

H. Which businesses decided to ignore the Grateful

Passage III

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “Out of
Rembrandt's Shadow” by Matthew Gurewitsch (©2009 by
Smithsonian Institution).

Telescopes trained on the night sky, astronomers
observe the phenomenon of the binary star, which
appears to the naked eye to be a single star but consists
in fact of two, orbiting a common center of gravity.

5 Sometimes, one star in the pair can so outshine the
other that its companion may be detected only by the
way its movement periodically alters the brightness of
the greater one.

The binary stars we recognize in the firmament of
10 art tend to be of equal brilliance: Raphael and
Michelangelo, van Gogh and Gauguin, Picasso and
Matisse. But the special case of an “invisible” compan-
ion is not unknown. Consider Jan Lievens, born in
Leiden in western Holland on October 24, 1607, just
15 15 months after the birth of Rembrandt van Rijn,
another Leiden native.

While the two were alive, admirers spoke of them
in the same breath, and the comparisons were not
always in Rembrandt’s favor. After their deaths,

20 Lievens dropped out of sight—for centuries. Though
the artists took quite different paths, their biographies
show many parallels. Both served apprenticeships in
Amsterdam with the same master, returned to that city
later in life and died there in their 60s. They knew each

25 other, may have shared a studio in Leiden early on, def-
initely shared models and indeed modeled for each
other. They painted on panels cut from the same oak
tree, which suggests they made joint purchases of art
supplies from the same vendor. They later showed the

30 same unusual predilection for drawing on paper
imported from the Far East.

The work the two produced in their early 20s in

Leiden was not always easy to tell apart, and as time

went on, many a superior Lievens was misattributed to

35 Rembrandt. Quality aside, there are many reasons why

one artist’s star shines while another’s fades. It mat-

tered that Rembrandt spent virtually his entire career in

one place, cultivating a single, highly personal style,

whereas Lievens moved around, absorbing many differ-

40 ent influences. Equally important, Rembrandt lent him-

self to the role of the lonely genius, a figure dear to the

Romantics, whose preferences would shape the tastes
of generations to come.

While Lievens’ name will be new to many, his

45 work may not be. The sumptuous biblical spectacular

The Feast of Esther, for instance, was last sold, in 1952,

as an early Rembrandt, and was long identified as such

in 20th-century textbooks. It is one of more than

130 works featured in the current tour of the interna-

50 tional retrospective “Jan Lievens: A Dutch Master
Rediscovered.”

The artworks, in so many genres, are hardly the
works of an also-ran. “We’ve always seen Lievens

www.actexam.net

ACT-74H

through the bright light of Rembrandt, as a pale reflec-

56 tion.” says Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., curator of northern
Baroque paintings at the National Gallery. “This show
lets you embrace Lievens from beginning to end, to
understand that this man has his own trajectory and that
he wasn’t-always in the gravity pull of Rembrandt.”

60 Wheelock has been particularly struck by the muscular-
ity and boldness of Lievens, which is in marked con-
trast to most Dutch painting of the time. “The approach
is much rougher, much more aggressive,” he says.
“Lievens was not a shy guy with paint. He manipulates

65 it, he scratches it. He gives it a really physical
presence.”

Lievens painted The Feast of Esther around 1625,
about the time Rembrandt returned to Leiden. It is
approximately four and a half by five and a half feet,

70 with figures shown three-quarter length, close to the
picture plane. (At that time, Rembrandt favored smaller
formats.) At the luminous center of the composition, a
pale Queen Esther points an accusing finger at Haman,
the royal councilor. Her husband, the Persian King

75 Ahasuerus, shares her light, his craggy face set off by a
snowy turban and a mantle of gold brocade. Seen from
behind, in shadowy profile, Haman is silhouetted
against shimmering white drapery, his right hand flying
up in dismay.

80 Silks, satins and brocades, elegant plumes and
gemstones—details like these give Lievens ample scope
to show off his flashy handling of his medium. Not for
him the fastidious, enamel-smooth surfaces of the
Leiden Fijnschilders—‘“fine painters.” in whose meticu-

85 lously rendered oils every brush stroke disappeared.
Lievens reveled in the thickness of the paint and the
way it could be shaped and scratched and swirled with
a brush, even with the sharp end of a handle. This tac-
tile quality is one of Rembrandt’s hallmarks as well;

90 there are now those who think he picked it up from
Lievens.

21. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A. argue that Lievens’s artworks are superior to
Rembrandt’s and deserve to be shown in their own
retrospective.

B. bring Lievens out of obscurity by discussing him
as both a peer of Rembrandt and an artist in his
own right.

C. criticize the art world’s belated recognition of
Rembrandt and Lievens as an artistic pair.

D. illustrate the profound differences between
Lievens’s artistic training and Rembrandt’s.

22. In the passage, both the author and Wheelock describe
the effect that Rembrandt’s popularity had on Lievens
by:

F. analyzing biographical similarities between the
two artists.

G. comparing Lievens’s early work to his later work.

H._ personifying Lievens’s painting style.

J. using astronomy metaphors.

Page 35:
23. In the context of the passage, the main purpose of the
first paragraph is to introduce:

A. a scientific phenomenon that mirrors the relation-
ship between Rembrandt and Lievens.

B. an exceptional painting by Lievens that was attrib-
uted to Rembrandt.

C. the innovative culture in which Rembrandt and
Lievens lived.

D. ahistorical event that inspired both Rembrandt and
Lievens.

The passage most nearly suggests that, in contrast to
Rembrandt and Lievens, other artists who are consid-
ered members of artistic pairs have tended to:

F. build their reputations by staying in just one city.
G. be underappreciated during their lifetimes.

H. achieve equal recognition in the art world.

J. have few biographical similarities.

In the context of the passage, the description of the

subjects featured in the painting The Feast of Esther

(lines 72-79) mainly serves to:

A. provide an analogy for the tense relationship
between Rembrandt and Lievens.

B. demonstrate how Lievens’s art reflected Dutch
political dynamics. -

C. illustrate Lievens’s bold painting style and atten-
tion to detail.

D. exemplify techniques common to Dutch painting
of the time.

The passage indicates that Lievens’s recognition in the
art community declined most significantly at which of
the following times?

F. When Lievens returned to Amsterdam

G. While Lievens was painting The Feast of Esther
H. When Rembrandt returned to Leiden

J. After Rembrandt and Lievens died

ACT-74H

27. The passage most strongly suggests that Lievens migh:

have attained more recognition if he had painted:

A. in collaboration with other artists.
B. more historical subjects.

C. in one specific style.

D. in smaller formats.

The passage indicates that Rembrandt appealed to the
Romantics because:

F. he fit their ideal of the lonely and brilliant artist.

G._ he traveled widely and absorbed many influences.
H. his artwork featured scenes of courtship and love.
J. his artwork shaped the tastes of later generations.

The fact that The Feast of Esther was misidentified as
an early Rembrandt painting is most directly used ir
the passage to support the author’s claim that Lievens’s
work:

A. is considered by modern art critics to be inferior to
Rembrandt’s.

B. peaked in quality during Lievens’s early adulthood.

C. may be familiar to some even though Lievens’s
name is not.

D. can be difficult for art exhibitors to obtain.

The last sentence of the passage most nearly serves to:

F. summarize the passage’s arguments about why
Lievens did not achieve lasting fame.

G. suggest that Lievens may have influenced
Rembrandt artistically.

H. argue that Lievens and Rembrandt collaborated
while they were in Leiden.

J. outline a controversy regarding the authenticity of
some Rembrandt paintings.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Call of the Leviathan” by Eric Wagner (©2011 by Smithsonian
Institution).

In 1839, in the first scientific treatise on the sperm
whale, Thomas Beale, a surgeon aboard a whaler, wrote
that it was “one of the most noiseless of marine ani-
mals.” While they do not sing elaborate songs, like

5 humpbacks or belugas, in fact they are not silent.
Whalers in the 1800s spoke of hearing loud knocking,
almost like hammering on a ship’s hull, whenever
sperm whales were present. Only in 1957 did two scien-
tists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

10 confirm the sailors’ observations. Aboard a research
vessel, the Atlantis, they approached five sperm whales,
shut off the ship’s motors and listened with an under-
water receiver. At first, they assumed the “muffled,
smashing noise” they heard came from somewhere on

15 the ship. Then they determined the sounds were coming
from the whales.

Biologists now believe that the sperm whale’s
massive head functions like a powerful telegraph
machine, emitting pulses of sound in distinct patterns.

20 At the front of the head are the spermaceti organ, a
cavity that contains the bulk of the whale’s spermaceti,
and a mass of oil-saturated fatty tissue. Two long nasal
passages branch away from the bony nares of the skull,
twining around the spermaceti organ and the fatty

25 tissue. The left nasal passage runs directly to the blow-
hole at the top of the whale’s head. But the other twists.
and turns, flattens and broadens, forming a number of
air-filled sacs capable of reflecting sound. Near the
front of the head sit a pair of clappers called “monkey

30 lips.”

Sound generation is a complex process. To make
its clicking sounds, a whale forces air through the right
nasal passage to the monkey lips, which clap shut. The
resulting click! bounces off one air-filled sac and trav-

35 els back through the spermaceti organ to another sac
nestled against the skull. From there, the click is sent
forward, through the fatty tissue, and amplified out into
the watery world. Sperm whales may be able to manip-
ulate the shape of both the spermaceti organ and the

40 fatty tissue, possibly allowing them to aim their clicks.

Biologist Dr. Hal Whitehead has identified four
patterns of clicks. The most common clicks are used for
long-range sonar. So-called “creaks” sound like a
squeaky door and are used at close range when prey

45 capture is imminent. “Slow clicks” are made only by
large males, but no one knows precisely what they
signify. (“Probably something to do with mating,”
Whitehead guesses.) Finally, “codas” are distinct pat-
terns of clicks most often heard when whales are

50 socializing.

Codas are of particular interest. Whitehead has

found that different groups of sperm whales, called
vocal clans, consistently use different sets; the reper-

ACT-74H

toire of codas the clan uses is its dialect. Vocal clans

55 can be huge—thousands of individuals spread out over
thousands of miles of ocean. Clan members are not nec-
essarily related. Rather, many smaller, durable matrilin-
eal units make up clans, and different clans have their
own specific ways of behaving.

60 A recent study in Animal Behaviour took the spe-
cialization of codas a step further. Not only do clans
use different codas, the authors argued, but the codas
differ slightly among individuals. They could be, in
effect, unique identifiers: names.

65 Whitehead cautions that a full understanding of
codas is still a long way off. Even so, he believes the
differences represent cultural variants among the clans.
“Think of culture as information that is transmitted
socially between groups,” he says. “You can make pre-

70 dictions about where it will arise: in complex societies,
richly modulated, among individuals that form self-
contained communities.” That sounds to him a lot like
sperm whale society.

But most of a sperm whale’s clicking, if not most

75 of its life, is devoted to one thing: finding food. And in

the Sea of Cortez, the focus of its attention is Dosidicus
gigas, the jumbo squid.

The most celebrated natural antagonism between

sperm whales and squid almost certainly involves the

80 jumbo squid’s larger cousin, the giant squid, a species

that grows to 65 feet long. The relationship between

sperm whales and squid is pretty dramatic. A single

sperm whale can eat more than one ton of squid per

day. They do eat giant squid on occasion, but most of

85 what whales pursue is relatively small and over-

matched. With their clicks, sperm whales can detect a

squid less than a foot long more than a mile away, and

schools of squid from even farther away. But the way

that sperm whales find squid was until recently a
90 puzzle.

31. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A. describe how sperm whales use clicks to hunt their
prey.

B. evaluate historical theories regarding sperm whale
clicks.

C. provide details about the antagonism between
sperm whales and squid.

D. explain how sperm whales generate and use clicks.

32, In the eighth paragraph (lines 74-77), the passage
begins to focus on the relationship between:

F. squid and their prey.

G._ sperm whales and sonar.
H. sperm whales and codas.
J. squid and sperm whales.

The main purpose of the second paragraph (lines

17-30) is to:

A. compare sperm whales to telegraph machines.

B. explain the function of the spermaceti organ.

C. outline how scientists came to understand the
anatomy of the sperm whale.

D. describe the sperm whale anatomy involved in cre-
ating sound.

It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that
codas are of particular interest because scientists don’t
yet fully understand:

F._ how codas help sperm whales hunt.

G. how codas function in sperm whale socialization.
H. why codas are emitted only by male whales.

J. why codas are so difficult to detect.

As it is presented in the passage, the study that
appeared in Animal Behaviour concluded that sperm
whale vocal clans:

. each use a distinct dialect, and individuals within
each clan have unique codas.

can adopt the codas of other clans, but individuals
within each clan maintain unique dialects.

each use many dialects, and individuals within
each clan develop complex codas.

Passage Ill

Both bats and birds have wings used for flight. Two
students present opposing views about whether the pres-
ence of the wings is an indication that bats and birds are
more closely related to each other than either is to other
vertebrates without wings, such as humans. Included in
each student’s presentation is a cladogram, a diagram that
shows the evolutionary history of several species. A clado-
gram organizes species into clades based on descent from a
common ancestor. A clade is a set of related species and
their most recent common ancestor (MRCA).

Student I

Although both have wings, bats and birds are not more
closely related to each other than either is to other verte-
brates without wings. Although the wings of bats and birds
evolved in response to similar selective forces, they
evolved independently of one another, as shown in
Figure 1. The wings of birds evolved at Point A, whereas
the wings of bats evolved at Point B.

Point A

birds

Point B
bats

humans

Figure 1

A bat can move individual wing bones, much like the
fingers can be moved in a human hand. The bones in a bird
wing are fused and inflexible. Thus, the bone structure of a
bat wing is more similar to the bone structure of a human
hand than to the bone structure of a bird wing. Further-
more, the fact that both bats and humans share mammalian
characteristics provides additional evidence that bats are
more closely related to humans than to birds.

ACT-74H

42

Student 2

Their both having wings is a good indication that bats
and birds are more closely related to each other than either
is to other vertebrates without wings. The MRCA of all
vertebrates with wings must have had wings. As shown in
Figure 2, the MRCA of bats and birds, represented at
Node Z, evolved to give rise to all winged vertebrates.

Point W

humans

Point X
bats

birds

Figure 2

Evidence that the bone structure of a bat wing is simi-
lar to that of a human hand does not indicate that bats and
humans are closely related because bats, birds, and humans
all have a similar forelimb bone structure. Humans and bats
are both mammals, but the mammalian characteristics
of humans and of bats evolved at Points W and X,
respectively.

14, Student 2’s cladogram indicates that which of the ver-
tebrates listed below belong to the clade that originates
at Node Z ?

I. Humans
Il. Bats
IH. Birds

15. Consider the statement “Bats have a small claw that
sticks out of the wing and functions like a human
thumb, allowing the bat to hang onto and climb on
trees.” This statement supports the view of which
student?

16,

17.

A.

Student 1, because Student 1 claims that any
descendant of an ancestor with forelimbs will have
a nonfunctional structure that resembles a human
thumb.

Student 1, because Student | claims that the simi-
larity of bone structure between a bat wing and a
human hand provides evidence that bats and
humans are closely related.

Student 2, because Student 2 claims that any
descendant of an ancestor with forelimbs will have
a nonfunctional structure that resembles a human
thumb.

Student 2, because Student 2 claims that the simi-
larity of bone structure between a bat wing and a
human hand provides evidence that bats and
humans are closely related.

In Student I’s cladogram, is the MRCA of bats and
humans represented at Node C or at Node D ?

i

G.

Node C, because the clade that begins with the
ancestor represented at Node C includes bats and
humans, as well as birds, as descendants.

Node C, because the clade that begins with the
ancestor represented at Node C includes bats and
humans, but not birds, as descendants.

Node D, because the clade that begins with the
ancestor represented at Node D includes bats and
humans, as well as birds, as descendants.

Node D, because the clade that begins with the
ancestor represented at Node D includes bats and
humans, but not birds, as descendants.

Passage V

The processing of sulfur-rich ore (rock containing
valuable metals) from mines produces liquid waste, which
is often stored in a pond. Some of the liquid in the pond
seeps down to the groundwater table, where it, contaminates
the groundwater beneath with sulfate (SO, ~). A barrier
called a reactive wail can be installed in the ground near
the pond to lessen soe contamination. As polluted water
flows through the wall, SO,’ is removed from the water
(see Figure 1). The material that forms the wall—the
reactive material (RM)—is composed of one or more
organic substances,

The following procedures were performed for each
RM: First, a 500 mL volume of the RM was placed inalL
flask. Next, 500 mL of a simulated liquid mine waste with
an SO,’ concentration of 3,600 mg/L was added to the
flask. The flask opening was then covered with an airtight
cap. Every 5 days, a 10 mL sample of the liquid in the flask
was collected through a seal in the cap. Each sample was
analyzed for SO,>. Once a sample was found to have
an So," concentration of zero, no additional samples were
collected from the flask.

Passage VI

Consider an electron that is constrained to move along
the x-axis. The probability of finding the electron at any
given location, x, along the axis is obtained from a distribu-
tion function, DF, which is related to the electron’s energy.
The greater the value of DF at a given x, the greater the
probability of finding the electron at that x. Classical
theory and quantum theory can be used to derive 2 forms of
DF: a classical form and a quantum form.

Table 1 lists the electron energy corresponding to each
of 4 DFs. Figure 1 shows the classical and quantum forms

of each DF.

Each Quantum DF represents a unique physical state
of the electron. The electron may make a transition
from one state to another by either absorbing or emit-
ting energy. Based on Table 1, if the electron were ini-
tially in the state represented by DF, and then made a
transition to the state represented by DF, would the
electron more likely absorb energy or emit energy, and
how much? The electron would:

A. absorb 4 eV.

B. absorb 6 eV.

C. emit 4 eV.

D. emit 6 eV.

At locations between —Xy 4, aNd +X pax. the value of
Classical DF is inversely proportional to the electron’s
speed. Based on Table | and Figure 1, at which of the
following locations is a 5 eV electron most likely
moving fastest?

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. if the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

Directions

This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On the
answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered to
match the questions, and the ovals in each row are lettered
to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the oval
in that row lettered the same as your answer. Finally, fill in
the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil and make your
marks heavy and black. Do not use ink or a mechanical
pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark thoroughly
before marking your new answer. For each question, make
certain that you mark in the row of ovals with the same
number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document will
be scored. Your score on each test will be based only on
the number of questions you answer correctly during the
time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized for
guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing staff
tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is called
for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a tesi on which time has already
been called, and you may not go ahead to another test. To
do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called at
the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill in or
alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test. To do
so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

Expertise

ACT® Writing Test Prompt

We have long depended on experts for the knowledge and critical insight they have gained through
years of study and experience. With the advent of the Internet, however, information is literally at our
fingertips. One can find answers to almost any question in a matter of seconds, without having to consult
an expert. To what extent, then, is expertise becoming obsolete? How should we understand the role of
an expert in an age of unprecedented access to information? As the Internet becomes an increasingly
thorough source of knowledge that was once held only by specialists, it is worth considering the value

of expertise.

Read and carefully consider these perspectives. Each suggests a particular way of thinking about the

value of expertise.

Writing Test Scores Overview

Two trained readers scored your essay on a scale of 1-6

in each of the four writing domains: Ideas and Analysis,
Development and Support, Organization, and Language Use
and Conventions. The ACT Writing Test Scoring Rubric
provided below presents the standards by which your essay

was evaluated.

Each domain score represents the sum of the two readers’

single subject-level writing score reported on a range of 2-12,
and four domain scores, also 2—12, that are based on an
analytic scoring rubric. The subject-level score will be the
rounded average of the four domain scores.

Because each domain receives its own score, the four scores
will not necessarily be identical. For example, you may find

that your essay exhibited stronger skill in organization than in

scores. You will receive a total of five scores for this test: a
