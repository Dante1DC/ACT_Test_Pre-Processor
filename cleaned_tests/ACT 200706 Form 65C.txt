. Picturing the Past
{1}

Before I left home to attend college, my grandmother
gave me 2 bag filled with old photographic negatives.
Having enrolled in a photography class for my first
semester, I had offered to preserve some of our family’s
memories before the film deteriorated or got lost. My
grandmother patted my hand and said, “Good luck,
Angela.”

told my grandmother doubtfully over the phone, “but I'll

greeting cards. Holding them up to the light, I could

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel The
Alchemist: A Fable About Following Your Dreams by Paulo
Coehlo (©1993 by Paulo Coehio).

Dusk was falling as Santiago arrived with his herd
at an abandoned church.

He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it
that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and
then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock
from wandering away during the night.

He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down,
using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow.

Jt was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up,
he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.

He arose and, taking up his staff, began to awaken
the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as
he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was
as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of
the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years,
leading them through the countryside in search of food
and water. “They are so used to me that they know my
schedule,” he muttered. Thinking about that for a
moment, he realized that it could be the other way
around: that it was he who had become accustomed to
their schedule.

He had always believed that the sheep were able to
understand what he said. So there were tmes when he
read them parts of his books that had made an impres-
sion on him, or when he would tell them of the loneli-
ness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields.

But for the past few days he had spoken to them
about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a mer-
chant who lived in the village they would reach in
about four days. The merchant owned a dry goods shop,
and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in
his presence. The boy had taken his sheep there the
year before.

“I need to sell some wool,” the boy told the mer-
chant. The shop was busy, and the man asked the shep-
herd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the
steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.

“J didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said
a girl’s voice behind him.

“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than
from books,” he answered. During the two hours that
they talked, she told him she was the merchant's daugh-
ter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was
like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalu-
sian countryside, and related the news from the other
towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change
from talking to his sheep.

“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one
point.

“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”

And now it was only four days before he would be
back in that same village. He was excited, and at the
same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten
him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their

5 wool.

“Jr doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know
other girls in other places.”

But in his heart be knew that it did matter. And he
knew that shepherds, like sailors and like traveling
salespeople, always found a town where there was
someone who could make them forget the joys of care-
free wandering.

The dey was dawning, and the shepherd urged his
sheep in the direction of the sun. He drank a bit, and he
gathered his jacket closer to his body.

The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His
purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of
walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of
the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to
the girl how it was that a shepherd knew how to read.
His parents had wanted him to become 2 priest, and
thereby a source of pride for a simple farm famil.
They worked hard just to have food and water. He had
studied Latin, Spanish, and theology. But ever since he
had been a child, he had wanted to know the world.
One afternoon, he had summoned up the courage to tell
his father that he didn’t want to become a priest. That
he wanted to travel.

“People from all over-the world have passed
through this village, son,” said his father. “They come
in search of new things, but when they leave they
basically the same people they were when they arrived.
They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted from the article."A
Proverb Each Day Keeps This Scholar at Play" by Richard
Wolkomir (©1292 by Smithsonian Institution).

Ever since emigrating to the United States from
Germany at age 16, Wolfgang Mieder has left no
proverbial stone unturned. Besides teaching about
proverbs at the University of Vermont, he has published

5 more than 50 books on his favorite subject, including
the massive Oxford University Press Dictionary of
American Proverbs. .

Mieder can tell you the origin of the proverb “One
picture is worth a thousand words.” Its structure, he
says, is one of the universal types: “One of somethi
is worth vast numbers of something else.” He can spin
off examples, such as “One good head is better than a
hundred strong hands” (English), “A friend is better
than a thousand silver pieces” (Greek), “A moment is
worth a thousand gold pieces” (Korean), “A single
penny fairly got js worth a thousand that are not”
(German), and “Silence is worth a thousand pieces of
silver” (Burmese).

10

15

The structure of “One picture is worth a thousand.
words” may derive from a familiar type, but the actual
proverb was dreamed up in 1921 by Fred R. Barnard of
the Street Railways Advertising Company. He used it in
a piece he wrote for an advertising journal, advocating
pictures in advertisements.

20

25 “One picture” hit on something about how the
mind works—at least, the American mind in the
nascent media age—and became part of the national
psychic genome. That js one way to look at proverbs: as
bits of mental DNA passed on from generation to gen-
eration. Some persist, others mutate and evolve. Some
disappear. But proverbs are slippery things, and defin-

ing them precisely has eluded proverb scholars, or
paroemiologists.

30

“Proverbs are crystallized bits of wisdom,” says
Mieder, adding that they average seven words, tend to
have several levels of meaning and apply, to various sit-
uations. That is why they are not necessarily true. If
“absence makes the heart grow fonder,” why do we say
“Out of sight, out of mind”? And if “He*who hesitates
js lost,” how come you have to “Look before you
leap"? Mix and match, says Mieder. “We pick the
proverb that fits the situation.” He has his own favorite
definition: “A proverb is a concise statement of an
apparent truth that has currency.”

_ Folklorists note that proverbs” meanings depend
on the situations in which they are used. And many
proverbs do not fit our changed society. A city youth
who has never met a Rhode Island Red chicken might
have trouble deciphering “Never cackle unless you
lay.” Nationality also can affect interpretations. The
Scots, for instance, tend to read.“A rolling stone
gathers no moss” as extolling the virtues of action as

the more sedentary life: The English, how-

opposed to
ever, tend to equate it with the beautiful growth of moss
on @ stone in a stream, a metaphor for tradition and
stability.

“These examples suggest that proverbs reveal

“national character.” But paroemiologists following

that road have hit a dead end. “I could put together a
bunch of proverbs that show Americans are miaterialis-
tic, and I could put together another collection showing
that Americans really value friendship and love,” says
Mieder. “If I know the 300 most common American
proverbs, the ones we really use, then maybe I can say
something.”

In fact, that is one of Mieder’s projects, although
aimed at a different goal than determining national!
character. The idea of establishing a country’s “prover-
bial minimum” began in Russia in the 1970s, when
scholars identified about 300 proverbs that every Russ-
jan knows. In the former Soviet Union, people of many
“nationalities often found themselves struggling to learn
Russian, a proverb-rich language, and mastering the
proverbial minimum was vital. Now efforts are under
way to establish proverbial minimums’ for other
nations, too.

Mieder is pushing the project in the United States:
“I've already done ‘statistical analyses, figuring out
which proverbs are particularly frequent in 20th-
century U.S. writing.” Mieder cautions, however, “we
would have to distribute about 10,000 questionnaires
around the United States to see. what proverbs people
actually use.” Establishing a U.S. proverbial minimum
will ease the path for immigrants jearning English, he
adds.

Meanwhile, linguists are taking a whack at the
world’s millions of extant proverbs, trying to reduce
them to a small number of basic structures. On one
level, they reduce proverbs to simple formulas, like
“Where there’s X, there’s Y.” But on a deeper level.
where they use symbolic logic, their results are pages
full of pluses, minuses, equal signs and does-not-equal
signs.

Which of the following groups 1s NOT mentioned in
the passage as being ‘associated with the study of
proverbs?

A. Linguists

B. Anthropol: ~
C. Paroemiolog'

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “The
‘Ascent of Glass” by Jeffrey Hogrefe (©2001 by the Smithson-
jan Institution).

One of the most striking of the uansparent glass
buildings that are appearing like ghostly apparitions in
cities around the world, the Rose Center for Earth and
Space at the American Museum of Natural History in
Manhattan marks a new age in glass architecture. Not
since the early 1950s, when sleek, green-tinted glass
buildings like New York City’s Lever House rose amid
the stone canyons of countless major cities, has glass
elicited so much attention. There are so many glass
buildings currently on the drawing boards or under con-
struction, in fact, that it is hard to keep track of them
all. “Glass is back,” says Kenneth Frampton, professor
of architecture at Columbia University and author of
Modern Architecture: A Critical History. And now it’s
taking center stage.

Like the Rose Center, many of the new glass edi-
fices are signature buildings. That is to say, the struc-
ture itself is used to communicate a message to the
public about the occupants” underlying philosophies.
“We wanted to build a structure that would say sci-
ence,” says Rose Center lead designer James Polshek.
In the year since the Rose Center opened to the public,
jt drew crowds beyond the wildest expectations of the
museum's directors. Many people go just to see the
pristine glass cube, which houses the spherical alu-
minum Hayden Planetarium as if it were a ship in a
giant glass bottle. The museum’s directors were ini-
tially reluctant to give the green light to such an experi-
mental system of glass construction because nothing
like it had been used here in the United States.
Although many of the icons of early glass architecture
rose in U.S. cities during the years after World War H,
since the energy crisis of 1973 most of the advances in
glass architecture have taken place in Europe. The
directors approved the design only after a trip to France
to see the building's prototype, the Cité de Sciences &
Industrie, in Paris. Completed in 1986, the museum
used an innovative structural device designed by the
Paris-based firm of Rice Francis Ritchie. The system
suspended the glass wall in front of a Series of metal
trusses and braces that held the glass panels in a state of
tension.

Glass has many virtues. It lets in light, and brings
the outside in and the inside out. Glass is also impervi-
ous to the effects of most harsh chemicals and thus is
less susceptible to damage from acid rain, which eats
away at masonry buildings. Furthermore, advancements
in glass production since the 1973 energy crisis have
resulted in revolutionary changes in its performance.

Kenneth Frampton sees the return to glass build-
ings as a symbol of progress. “We do see glass coming
back, and with the comeback it has to be effective envi-
ronmentally,” he says. “The early glass curtain wall was
only slightly more efficient than no wall.” The new

glass is not only spectacular to'look at and through, it is
also more efficient and much safer than the old glass.
Stringent energy codes have led to many innovations.
Glass is now being manufactured with special coatings
that adjust the thermal intake for all four directions of
the compass and even allow for the. increased intensity
of the sun at certain latitudes. For the new LVME
(Louis Vuitton Moét Hennessy) building, which opened
in midtown Manhattan in 1999, more than 30 different
types of glass were used in the curtain wall in order to
meet New York City’s energy codes and create an
arresting facade of contrasting textures and colors.

Old glass buildings, too, are benefiting from the
improvements in glass. Completed in 1952, Park
Avenue’s Lever House was one of the first glass-walled
buildings in Manhattan. Gonstruction was:recently fin-
ished on a two-year renovation, undertaken because the
original glass had begun to crack. The structure has
now been completely reclad with a new, stronger ver-
sion of the glass originally used in the building.

“Glass is being argued as a new material,” notes
architect Robert A. M. Stern, dean of the School of
Architecture at Yale University. “It’s being rediscov-
ered after a generation of architects who rejected.it.”

Glass can serve as a lens, revealing and bringing
into focus the interior of buildings—as in the Rose
Center, and in the award-winning Hillier Group design
for the power plant that supplies electricity to New
York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
inner workings of the plant are exposed to view through
the building’s transparent glass walls. Unlike tradi-
tional power plants, which disguise themselves as other
types of buildings, the JFK design. is as honest as it is
bold. “The underlying point of the design was that
power is beautiful,” says project architect David Finci

Jt can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that the author views the statement by Frampton in
line 12 as:

A. an exaggeration of the role of glass in architecture

today.

B. a gross oversimplification of a complicated issue
regarding glass.

.C. a suggestion about glass that
someday. @

D. an accurate comment about the use of glass in con-
temporary architecture.

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“Is There Life on Other Planets?” by Victoria Pope (©2002 by
U.S. News and World Report, Inc.).

The search for life on other planets is a quest.of
vast intrinsic interest but of extreme difficulty in prac-
tice. Its root iogic, though, is simple enough: If life was
brewed on the planet Earth in a primordial soup of
chemicals 4 billion to 4.5 billion years ago, why
shouldn’t it have happened on at least one other planet
in the universe, too? Astronomers calculate that hun-
dreds of millions of Earth-like planets must exist
throughout the universe.

Early space exploration didn’t turn up life. When
NASA’s Viking landers examined Mars two decades
ago, they found a dry, sterile environment. Venus was a
blazing inferno. It was only the images from the Galileo
spacecraft that raised a slight hope of finding suitable
conditions for life elsewhere in our solar system:
Jupiter’s moon Europa appeared to have an ocean of
liquid water covered with pack ice.

Scientists who are skeptical about life’s having
arisen elsewhere have had a strong case, given the pre-
cise conditions that seemed essential for life to develop
and survive. Planets that are too small cannot retain an
atmosphere at all. Those too large turn into gas balls,
like Jupiter. Those that are too hot or too cold have no
liquid water. And without water, the chemical process
of photosynthesis, which converts sunlight into chemi-
cal energy, is impossible. Without an atmosphere of
oxygen, the chemical reactions that allow a cell to
extract energy from other chemicals cannot normally
run, either.

But recent findings from our own planet have led
scientists to wonder if they’ve taken too parochial a
view of life, Microbes have been discovered thriving
under circumstances once thought impossible: in vol-
canic vents, in hot springs, in geysers. Antarctica’s
rocks, the cold waters deep beneath-the surface of its
frozen lakes, and the subterranean ground water below
the basalt flows of Washington State’s Columbia River
Basin may harbor terrestrial models for the rise of life
on Mars and other planets. And some tantalizing, if still
highly controversial, evidence from Mars at least hints
that some similar forms of life may indeed have arisen
there, even if they subsequently died out. A Martian
meteorite found in Antarctica contains microscopic
wormlike structures, dating from at least 3.6 billion
years ago, that resemble fossilized bacterial forms
found on Earth

The earthly microbes that seem to defy the odds
are members of a category loosely called
“extremophiles.” Among their hardy ranks are the ther-
mophiles, which thrive in searing heat; the halophiles,
which love salt; and the barophiles, bacteria often
found in the deep sea that live under high pressure.

ACT ASC

Evidence of life in inhospitable environments
began to pile up in recent years as highly sensi
55 gene-sequencing techniques made it possible to identify
microorganisms that wouldn't grow in petri dishes in
the lab. Before these techniques were available, scien-
tists were able to examine only about 1 percent of the
real microbial population. New exploration technolo-
60 gies have helped, too. Deep-diving submarines found
“cryptoendolithic” (“hiding within rock”) organism
whose metabolism is driven by heat from a geothermal
source.

Although the issue is highly contentious, some
researchers argue that many of these microbes belon
to a distinct and previously unrecognized branch of life.
Supporters of this idea say that these one-cell throw-
backs, now dubbed “archaea,” are genetically different
from bacteria and appear to be the oldest life forms on
70 Earth. If that’s so, it means that life did not necessarily

need some warm, hospitable primordial soup to for:
but could have originated in a far greatér range of env
ronments—including some downright hostile ones.

tained 2 U-shaped electrical conductor (USEC), a movable
conducting rod of length Z that connected the sides of the
USEC, and an ammeter (A). All conductors were made of
the same metal..Using a motor-driven shaft attached to the
conducting rod, the students could move the rod either to
the left or to the right at speed v (see Figure 1).

vertically toward the ceiling, The field was constant in

strength and direction. When the rod was moved, an
amount of electrical current, J, was generated in the circuit
made by the USEC and the conducting rod (see Figure 2).

Amylase is an enzyme that speeds up the breakdown
of starch into smalier carbohydrates (such as maltose).

A starch solution, ah amylase solution, and several -

buffer solutions (solutions that maintain a constant pH)
were prepared. Two experiments were done using these
solutions and the following tests:

© Iodine test: 3 drops of a brown KI, solution is added toa
sample solution. If starch is present in the sample solu-
tion, the solution will turn from brown to black.

» Benedict's test: 1 mL of a blue solution containing
CuSO, is. added to a sample solution. The solution is
then heated in a boiling water path for 3 min. If maltose
is present jn the sample solution, the solution will turn
from blue to orange.

Experiment 1

Each of 7 test tubes was filled with 5 mL of pH 7.0
buffer solution. Different amounts of starch solution and/or
amylase solution were added to each tube. The solution in
each tube was then diluted to 10 mL with the buffer solu-
tion (so the final pH was 7.0 in each tube). Each tube was
then incubated at a constant temperature for 10 min. The
jodine and Benedict’s tests were then each done with 2 mL
samples drawn from each tube (see Table 1).

Water flowing over the sediment in a river channel
creates bedforms (3-dimensional structures formed in the
sediment). The processes that produce bedforms in present-
day river channels produced thé same types of bedforms in
ancient river channels. Ancient bedforms are often found
preserved in sedimentary rock layers. Figure 1 shows a

layer of sand particles of uniform diameter was placed in
the bottom of the channel. Various combinations of water

. Passage Vil

Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the vapor
above a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature
and at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the rate of evaporation
equals the rate of condensation.

Two students observed that the vapor pressure of H,O
decreased when NaCl was dissolved in the H,O. The stu-
dents then offered explanations for why this ‘decrease
occurred.

Student I

Solvent molecules are attracted to charged solute par-
ticles. This causes solvent molecules to surround solute
particles, forming clusters. Additional energy is needed to
break solvent molecules free from these clusters. Thus, ata
given temperature, the vapor pressure of the solution is
Jower than that of the pure liquid. The vapor pressure
decreases as the concentration of charged solute particles
increases and as the magnitude of the charge on each solute
particle increases. Neutral solute particles do not affect the
vapor pressure of a liquid. -

Student 2

Vapor pressure decreases because some of the solvent
particles that have sufficient energy to éscape the solu-
tion’s surface collide with the solute particles and lose
energy. Thus, at a given temperature, the vapor pressure of
the solution is lower than that of the pure liquid. The size
of the decrease in vapor pressure is directly proportional to
the concentration of solute particles. A neutral solute parti-
cle decreases the vapor pressure of a liquid by the same
amount 2s does a charged solute particle. The concentra-
tion of solute particles is. the only factor that affects the
vapor pressure of a liquid.

Experiment

Three | kg solutions were made by dissolving
1.0 mole (6 x 10” units or molecules) of glucose, NaCl, or
CaCl, respectively, in distilled H,O. Thus, the concentra-

tion of each solution was 1.0 mole/kg. Table 1 shows the

solute particle(s) resulting from each unit (or molec’ ol
each substance dissolved in H,O. The students then mea-
sured the Vapor pressure of distilled H,O and of each solu-
tion at 25°C.

solution? © é
A. Yes; Student 1 claims solvent molecules are

B. Yes; Student 2 claims solvent molecules are

36. Based on Table 1, how did the concentration of solute
particles in Solution 3 compare to the concentration of
solute particles in Solution 1 ? The concentration of
solute particles in Solution 3 was:

E. lower; because each CaCl, unit dissolves into

Suppose an experiment showed that each Na” in a salt-

water solution exists in a cluster with 3 H;O mole-

cules. This finding would support the explanation(s) of |
which of the students, if either?

Student 1 only

Student 2 only

Both students

Neither student

Dorp

When table sugar is dissolved in pure H;O at 25°C, the
vapor pressure at equilibrium is lower than that of pure
H,O at 25°C. Because dissolved table sugar molecules
are neutral, this observation contradicts the explana-
tion of:

F. Student 1, because Student 1 claims that only
charged solute particles can cause the vapor pres-
sure to decrease.

G. Student 2, because Student 2 claims that only
charged solute particles can cause the vapor pres-
sure to decrease.

H. Student 1, because Student | claims that only

‘uncharged solute particles can cause the vapor
pressure to decrease.

J. Student 2, because Student 2 claims that only

unchargéd solute particles can cause the vapor
pressure to decrease.

With which of the following statements about solutes”
would both students agree? Adding to a liquid a sub-
stance that dissolves:

A. and dissociates into ions wil decrease the liquid’ Ss
vapor pressure.

and dissociates into ions will increase the liquid’s °

vapor pressure. -

but does not dissociate into ions will decrease the

liquid’s vapor pressure.

. but does not dissociate into ions will increase the
liquid’s vapor pressure.

B
c.
D.

Assume the following for the addition of a substance
to a pure liquid:
AP = the decrease in vapor pressure
C= the concentration of | solute particles
k= a constant

Which of the following equations is most consistent
with Student 2’s explanation?

BE aP=&

G. AP=kxC 7
=k

H. Ap=*

J. AP=KxC
