This booklet contains tests in English,
Mathematics, Reading, and Science. These tests
measure skills and abilities highly related to high
school course work and success in college.
CALCULATORS MAY BE USED ON THE
MATHEMATICS TEST ONLY.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered.
On the answer document, the rows of ovals are
numbered to match the questions, and the ovals in
each row are lettered to correspond to the suggested
answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is
best. Next, locate on the answer document the row
of ovals numbered the same as the question. Then,
locate the oval in that row lettered the same as your
answer. Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft
lead pencil and make your marks heavy and black.
DO NOT USE INK OR A MECHANICAL PENCIL.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you
change your mind about an answer, erase your first
mark thoroughly before marking your new answer.
For each question, make certain that you mark in the
row of ovals with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be
based only on the number of questions you answer
correctly during the time allowed for that test. You will
NOT be penalized for guessing. /T /S TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION
EVEN IF YOU MUST GUESS.

You may work on each test ONLY when your test
supervisor tells you to do so. If you finish a test
before time is called for that test, you should use the
time remaining to reconsider questions you are
uncertain about in that test. You may NOT look back
to a test on which time has already been called, and
you may NOT go ahead to another test. To do so will
disqualify you from the examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is
called at the end of each test. You may NOT for any
reason fill in or alter ovals for a test after time is
called for that test. To do so will disqualify you from
the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In the
right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

as a young adult, he refined his cooking skills at the

prestigiously acclaimed Culinary Institute of America.

In 1989, he came up with his idea for a line of Southern-

Question 60 asks about the preceding passage
as a whole.

indicates that pinball is superior to video games.
Would this essay fulfill the writer’s goal?

F. No, because the writer admits that video games
have become more popular than pinball machines.

G. No, because the writer states that video games are
designed to challenge the skills of the player.

H. Yes, because the writer claims that pinball games
require luck and are more visually attractive than
video games.

Paragraphs 1, 5, and 6 of this essay are written in the
second person (you, your). If these paragraphs were
revised so that the second-person pronouns were
replaced with the pronouns one and one’s, the essay
would primarily:

F. gain a more polite and formal tone appropriate to
the purpose of the essay.

G. gain accessibility by speaking to a broader and
more inclusive audience.

H. lose the sense of directly addressing and advising
the reader.

J. lose the immediacy of its setting in terms of time
and place.

75. Suppose the writer had decided to write an essay dis-

cussing the moral and ethical consequences of pro-

gramming a computer virus to tamper with a computer

system. Would this essay successfully fulfill the
writer's goal?

A. Yes, because the essay explains the moral and eth-
ical consequences when a virus enters a computer
system.

B. Yes, because the essay details the process of rid-
ding a computer system of viruses, which helps the
reader understand the consequences of program-
ming computer viruses.

C. No, because the essay does not explain how to
program a virus, so the reader has no basis for
making a moral or ethical judgment.

D. No, because the essay limits itself to describing
computer viruses and the basic precautions to be
taken against them.

DIRECTIONS: There are four passages in this test. Each
passage is followed by several questions. After reading
a passage, choose the best answer to each question
and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. You may refer to the passages as often as

necessary.

Passage I

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the short story
“Elba” by Marly Swick (©1991 by the University of lowa). Fran
is the narrator of the story.

Mother, who wanted to keep her, always thought
of her as some wild little bird, but I knew she was a
homing pigeon. I knew that at some point in her flight
path, sooner or later, she would make a U-turn. A sort
of human boomerang. So even though I had long since
stopped expecting it, I was not surprised when I walked
down the gravel drive to the mailbox, which I'd painted
papaya yellow to attract good news, and found the
flimsy envelope with the Dallas postmark. I didn’t
10 know a soul in Dallas, or Texas for that matter, but the

handwriting reminded me of someone’s. My own.

a

I walked back inside the house.

“Still raining?” Mother asked. She was sitting in
her new electric wheelchair in front of the TV, painting
15 her fingernails a neon violet.

“Just let up,” I said. “Sun’s poking through. You
know anyone in Dallas, Mother?”

“Not so as I recall.” She dabbed at her pinky with
a cottonball. Mother was vain about her hands. I was
20 used to how she looked now, but I noticed people
staring in the doctor’s waiting room. She had lost some
weight and most of her hair to chemotherapy, and I
guess people were startled to see these dragon-lady
nails on a woman who looked as if she should be lying

25 in satin with some flowers on her chest.

“Why do you ask?” she said.

I opened the envelope and a picture fluttered into
my lap. It was a Polaroid of a sweet-faced blond
holding a newborn baby in a blue blanket. Before I

30 even read the letter I knew. I knew how those Nazis
feel when suddenly, after twenty or thirty uneventful
years, they are arrested walking down some sunny
street in Buenos Aires. It’s the shock of being found
after waiting so long.

35 “What's that?” Mother said.

I wheeled her around to face me and handed her
the Polaroid. She studied it for a minute and then

looked up, speechless for once, waiting for me to set
the tone.

“That’s her,” I said. “Her name’s Linda Rose
Caswell.”

We looked at the picture again. The blond woman
was seated on a flowered couch, her wavy hair just
grazing the edge of a dime-a-dozen seascape in a cheap
gilt frame.

Mother pointed to the envelope. “What's she say?”
lL unfolded the letter, a single page neatly written.

“She says she’s had my name and address for
some time but wanted to wait to contact me until after
the birth. The baby’s name is Blake and he weighs eight
pounds, eight ounces, and was born by cesarean. She
says they are waiting and hoping to hear back from me
soon.”

“That’s it?”

I nodded and handed her the letter. It was short
and businesslike, but I could see the ghosts of all the
long letters she must have written and crumpled into
the wastebasket.

“T guess that makes you a great-grandmother,” I
said.

“What about you?” she snorted, pointing a Jungle
Orchid fingernail at me. “You’re a grandmother.”

We shook our heads in disbelief. I sat silently, lis-
tening to my brain catch up with my history. Forty
years old and I felt as if I had just shaken hands with
Death. I suppose it’s difficult for any woman to accept
that she’s a grandmother, but in the normal order of
things, you have ample time to adjust to the idea. You
don’t get a snapshot in the mail one day from a baby
girl you gave up twenty-four years ago saying,
“Congratulations, you’re a grandma!”

“It’s not fair,” I said. “I don’t even feel like a
mother.”

“Well, here’s the living proof.” Mother tapped her

nail against the glossy picture. “She looks just like you.
Only her nose is more aristocratic.”

Mother nodded, scrutinizing the picture in her lap.
“You going to write to her?”

“Of course I am,”.I bristled. “I may be some
things, but I am not rude.”

“You going to invite them here? Her and the
baby?” She swiveled her eyes sideways at me.

“J haven’t thought that far,” I said.

“Well, don’t put it off.” She slid her eyes back to
the television. “She’s been waiting twenty-five years.
You worried she’s going to be trouble or ask for
money? For all we know, she’s married to a brain sur-
geon with his and her Cadillacs.”

“She didn’t mention any husband at all,” I said,
getting drawn into it despite myself.

“Maybe you're worried she’ll be disappointed in
you,” she said. “You know, that she’s had this big fan-
tasy for all these years that maybe you were Grace
Kelly or Margaret Mead and who could live up to that?
No one. But you don’t have to, Fran, that’s the thing.
You’re her flesh-and-blood mother and that’s enough.
That’s all it'll take.”

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from a book titled
How Courts Govern America by Richard Neely (©1981 by
Richard Neely).

Government is a technical undertaking, like the
building of rocketships or the organizing of railroad
yards. Except possibly on the local level, the issues
which attract public notice usually involve raising
money (taxes), spending money (public works), foreign
wars (preventing them or arguing for fighting easy
ones), education, public morals, crime in the streets,
and, most important of all, the economy. When times
are bad, or there is a nationwide strike or disaster,
interest in the economy becomes all-consuming.
However, the daily toiling of countless millions of civil
servants in areas such as occupational health and
safety, motor vehicle regulation, or control of navigable
waterways escapes public notice almost completely.

Furthermore, even with regard to high-visibility
issues, significant communication between the elec-
torate and public officials is extremely circumscribed.
Most serious political communication is limited to
forty-five seconds on the network evening news. In
days gone by, when the only entertainment in town ona
Wednesday night was to go to the county courthouse to
listen to a prominent politician give a theatrical tirade
against Herbert Hoover, an eloquent speaker could pack
the courthouse and have five thousand people lined up
to the railroad tracks listening to the booming loud-
speakers.

The political orator of yesteryear has been
replaced by a flickering image on the tube unlocking
the secrets of the government universe in forty-five-
second licks. Gone forever are Lincoln-Douglas type
debates on courthouse steps. Newspapers take up the
slack a little, but very little. Most of what one says to
a local newspaper (maybe not the New York Times)
gets filtered through the mind of an inexperienced
twenty-three-year-old journalism school graduate. Try
sometime to explain the intricacies of a program
budget, which basically involves solving a grand equa-
tion composed of numerous simultaneous differential
functions, to a reporter whose journalism school cur-
riculum did not include advanced algebra, to say
nothing of calculus.

But the electorate is as interested in the whys and
wherefores of most technical, nonemotional political

issues as I am in putting ships in bottles: they do not
particularly care. Process and personalities, the way
decisions are made and by whom, the level of
perquisites, extramarital sexual relations, and, in high
offices, personal gossip dominate the public mind,
while interest in the substance of technical decisions is
minimal. Reporters focus on what sells papers or gets a
high Nielsen rating; neither newspapers nor television
stations intend to Jose their primary value as entertain-
ment. Since the populace at large is more than willing
to delegate evaluation of the technical aspects of goy-
ernment to somebody else, it inevitably follows that
voting is a negative exercise, not a positive one. Angry
voters turn the rascals out and, in the triumph of hope
over experience, let new rascals in. What voters are
unable to do—because they themselves do not under-
stand the technical questions—is tell the rascals how to
do their jobs better.

Serious coverage of goings-on in government is
deterred by the fact that government is so technical that
even career civil servants cannot explain what is hap-
pening. In 1978 I attended a seminar on federal estate
and gift tax, where the Internal Revenue Service
lawyers responsible for this area frankly confessed that
they did not understand the Tax Reform Act of 1976.
Intricate technical issues such as taxation, arms control,
and nuclear power are difficult to understand for pro-
fessionals, to say nothing of the most diligent layman.

That anything gets done by a political body at all
is to be applauded as a miracle rather than accepted as a
matter of course. When we recognize that in the federal
government, with its millions of employees, there are
but five hundred and thirty-seven elected officials, put
into office to carry out the “will” of a people who for
the most part know little and care less about the tech-
nical functioning of their government, the absurdity of
the notion of rapid democratic responsiveness becomes
clear. The widely held tenet of democratic faith that
elected officials, as opposed to bureaucrats or the judi-
ciary, are popularly selected and democratically
responsive is largely a myth which gives a useful legiti-
macy to a system. In fact, however, far from democratic
control, the two most important forces in political life
are indifference and its direct byproduct, inertia.

One of the main points that the author seeks to make in
the passage is that American citizens:

A. cannot understand government because they read
too many newspapers and watch too much televi-
sion.

B. have little chance of improving government
because they do not understand the important
details of government.

C. can control elected officials’ technical decisions
through elections, but have no control over the
bureaucrats.

D. used to have a responsive. government before tele-
vision cut back on news and began to concentrate
on entertainment.

HUMANITIES: This passage

is adapted
Mukherjee’s essay “A Four-Hundred-Year-Old Woman,” which
appears in the anthology The Writer on Her Work (©1991 by
Janet Sternburg).

from Bharati

I was born into a class that did not live in its native
language. I was born into a city that feared its future,
and trained me for emigration. I attended a school run
by Irish nuns, who regarded our walled-off school
compound in Calcutta as a corner of England. My
“country”—called in Bengali desh—I have never seen.
It is the ancestral home of my father and is now
in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, I speak his dialect of
Bengali, and think of myself as “belonging” to
Faridpur, the tiny village that was his birthplace. The
larger political entity to which I gave my first alle-
giance-——India—was not even a sovereign nation when I
was born.

My horoscope, cast by a neighborhood astrologer
when I was a week-old infant, predicted that I would be
a writer, that I would cross oceans and make my home
among aliens. Brought up in a culture that places its
faith in horoscopes, it never occurred to me to doubt it.
The astrologer meant to offer me a melancholy future;
to be destined to leave India was to be banished from
the sources of true culture. The nuns at school, on the
other hand, insinuated that India had long outlived its
glories, and that if we wanted to be educated, modern
women, we’d better hit the trail westward. All my girl-
hood, I straddled the seesaw of contradictions.

1 have found my way to the United States after
many transit stops. The unglimpsed phantom Faridpur
and the all too real Manhattan have merged as “desh.” I
am an American. I am an American writer, in the
American mainstream, trying to extend it. This is a
vitally important statement for me—I am not an Indian
writer, not an expatriate. | am an immigrant; my invest-
ment is in the American reality, not the Indian.

It took me ten painful years, from the early seven-
ties to the early eighties, to overthrow the smothering
tyranny of nostalgia. The remaining struggle for me is
to make the American readership, meaning the editorial
and publishing industries as well, acknowledge the
same fact. The foreign-born, the Third World immi-
grant with non-Western religions and non-European
languages and appearance, can be as American as any
steerage passenger from Ireland, Italy, or the Russian
Pale.

My literary agenda begins by acknowledging that
America has transformed me. It does not end until I
show how I (and the hundreds of thousands like me)
have transformed America.

I’ve had to sensitize editors as well as readers to
the richness of the lives 'm writing about. The most
moving form of praise I receive from readers can be
summed up in three words: J never knew. Meaning, I
see these people (call them Indians, Filipinos, Koreans,

184

www.actexam.net

Chinese) around me all the time and I never knew they
had an inner life. I never knew they schemed and

55 cheated, suffered, cared so passionately. When even the
forms of praise are so rudimentary, the writer knows
she has an.inexhaustible fictional population to enu-
merate. Perhaps even a mission.

I have been blessed with an enormity of material:

60 the rapid and dramatic transformation of the United
States since the early 1970s. Within that perceived
perimeter, however, I hope to wring surprises.

Yet my imaginative home is also in the tales told
by my mother and grandmother, the world of the Hindu
65 epics. For all the hope and energy I have placed in the
process of immigration and accommodation—I’m a
person who couldn’t ride a public bus when she first
arrived, and now I’m someone who watches tractor
pulls on obscure cable channels—there are parts of
70 me that remain Indian, The form that my stories and
novels take inevitably reflects the resources of Indian
mythology—shape-changing, miracles, godly perspec-
tives. My characters can, I hope, transcend the strait-
jacket of simple psychologizing. The people I write
75 about are culturally and politically several hundred
years old: consider the history they have witnessed
(colonialism, technology, education, liberation, civil
war). They have shed old identities, taken on new ones,
and learned to hide the scars, They may sell you news-

80 papers, or clean your offices at night.

Writers (especially American writers weaned on
affluence and freedom) often disavow the notion of a
“literary duty” or “political consciousness,” citing the
all-too-frequent examples of writers ruined by their

85 shrill commitments. Glibness abounds on both sides of
the argument, but finally I have to side with my “Third
World” compatriots: I do have a duty, beyond telling a
good story. My duty is to give voice to continents, but
also to redefine the nature of American.

21. One of the main arguments the author is trying to make
in the passage is that:

A. until recently, foreign-born residents have not
wanted to be involved in defining the American
reality.

B. non-Western immigrants are changing the defini-
tion of what it means to be an American.

C. the United States immigration policy is inherently
unfair.

D. America has changed the political affiliations of
most non-Western immigrants.

Considering the information given in the first three
paragraphs (lines 1-33), which of the following is the
most accurate description of the author’s girlhood and
early adulthood?

F. She grew up and was educated in Calcutta, moved
to the United States, and lived in Manhattan.

G. She was born in Calcutta, was educated in England
by Irish nuns, then moved to Manhattan.

H. She was raised in Bangladesh, educated by Irish
nuns in Calcutta, moved first to England and some
time later arrived in the United States.

J. She was born in Faridpur, was educated in
Calcutta, then moved to Manhattan.

The author sees her “literary agenda” (line 44) and her
“mission” (line 58) to be:

A. raising the political consciousness of recent immi-
grants to the United States.

B. creating characters whose cultural heritage is not
easily identifiable.

C. reinterpreting, through her stories, what it means
to be an American.

D. finding an audience for her stories and novels.

Which of the following statements from the passage is

an acknowledgment by the author that she was

changed by America?

F. “The astrologer meant to offer me a melancholy

future” (line 19).

“All my girlhood, I straddled the seesaw of contra-

dictions” (lines 24-25).

“[’m someone who watches tractor pulls on

obscure cable channels” (lines 68-69).

J. “My characters can, I hope, transcend the strait-
jacket of simple psychologizing” (lines 73-74).

G.
H.

The author refers to the village of Faridpur as a
“phantom” (line 27) because:

A. it is a part of the Indian mythology her mother told
her about.

B. she considers Manhattan, not Bangladesh, to be
her home.

C. even though it was once part of India, it is now
part of Bangladesh,

D. even though she considers it to be her ancestral

home, she has never been there.

When the author says that she is “trying to extend it”
(line 30), she most likely means that she:

F. wants to see people from non-European ethnicities

included in what is considered mainstream

American.

prefers to be part of both the Indian and the

American cultures.

is trying to find a way to make her home in the

United States permanent.

J. is working to change regulations so that many
more Indian immigrants can live in the United
States.

27, The author implies that she had to “sensitize editors”

28,

29,

(line 48) because those editors:

did not understand that many Asian Americans
were already reading her work.

gave superficial praise to her work, but would not
publish her novels.

were overtly discriminatory when it came to non-
Western writers.

D. tended to view the people she wrote about as one-
dimensional.

According to the passage, by reading her stories, many
of the author’s readers learned that:

good fiction writing obscures cultural differences
among characters.

they have much more in common with the author’s
characters than they ever realized.

stories about immigrants to the United States gen-
erally have many more characters than do other
types of stories.

J. because of their immigrant status, people from
non-Western countries have developed a stronger
inner life than have most native-born Americans.

The first paragraph states that, at the time of the
author’s birth, India was:

A. engaged in a war with England.
B. not an independent country.

C.. still part of Bangladesh.

D. governed by the Irish.

30. When the author says that the people she writes about

“are culturally and politically several hundred years
old” (lines 75-76), she most likely means that her
characters:

F. have cultural and political viewpoints that are

repressive and outdated.

G. have rejected Bengali, British, Irish, and American
values.
H. have experienced an incredible amount of change

in just one lifetime.
J. are really her mother’s and grandmother’s ancestors.

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the essay
“Were Dinosaurs Dumb?” by Stephen Jay Gould (©1980 by
Stephen Jay Gould).

The discovery of dinosaurs in the nineteenth cen-
tury provided, or so it appeared, a quintessential case
for the negative correlation of size and smarts. With
their pea brains and giant bodies, dinosaurs became a
symbol of lumbering stupidity. Their extinction seemed
only to.confirm their flawed design.

Dinosaurs were not even granted the usual solace
of a giant—great physical prowess... . Dinosaurs . . .
have usually been reconstructed as slow and clumsy. In
the standard illustration, Brontosaurus wades in a
murky pond because he cannot hold up his own weight
on land. . . .

Dinosaurs have been making a strong comeback of
late, in this age of “I'm OK, You’re OK.” Most paleon-
tologists are now willing to view them as energetic,
active, and capable animals. The Brontosaurus that
wallowed in its pond a generation ago is now running
on land, while pairs of males have been seen twining
their necks about each other in elaborate sexual combat
for access to females (much like the neck wrestling of
giraffes). Modern anatomical reconstructions indicate
strength and agility, and many paleontologists now
believe that dinosaurs were warmblooded. . . .

The idea of warmblooded dinosaurs has captured
the public imagination and received a torrent of press
coverage. Yet another vindication of dinosaurian capa-
bility has received very little attention, although I
regard it as equally significant. I refer to the issue of
stupidity and its correlation with size. The revisionist
interpretation, which I support, . . . does not enshrine
dinosaurs as paragons of intellect, but it does maintain
that they were not small brained after all. They had the
“right-sized” brains for reptiles of their body size.

I don’t wish to deny that the flattened, minuscule
head of large-bodied Stegosaurus houses little brain
from our subjective, top-heavy perspective, but I do
wish to assert that we should not expect more of the
beast. First of all, large animals have relatively smaller
brains than related, small animals. The correlation of
brain size with body size among kindred animals (all
reptiles, all mammals for example) is remarkably reg-
ular. As we move from small to large animals, from
mice to elephants or small lizards to Komodo dragons,
brain size increases, but not so fast as body size. In
other words, bodies grow faster than brains, and large
animals have low ratios of brain weight to body weight.
In fact, brains grow only about two-thirds as fast as
bodies. Since we have no reason to believe that large
animals are consistently stupider than their smaller rel-
atives, we must conclude that large animals require
relatively less brain to do as well as smaller animals. If
we do not recognize this relationship, we are likely to
underestimate the mental power of very large animals,
dinosaurs in particular. ...

186

55 If behavioral complexity is one consequence of
mental power, then we might expect to uncover among
dinosaurs some signs of social behavior that demand
coordination, cohesiveness and recognition. Indeed we
do, and it cannot be accidental that these signs were

60 overlooked when dinosaurs labored under the burden of
a falsely imposed obtuseness. Multiple trackways have
been uncovered, with evidence for more than twenty
animals traveling together in parallel movement. Did
some dinosaurs live in herds? At the Davenport Ranch

65 sauropod trackway, small footprints lie in the center
and larger ones at the periphery, Could it be that some
dinosaurs traveled much as some advanced herbivorous
mammals do today, with large adults at the borders
sheltering juveniles in the center? .. .

70 But the best illustration of dinosaurian capability
may well be the fact most often cited against them—
their demise. .. .

The remarkable thing about dinosaurs is not that
they became extinct, but that they dominated the earth
75 for so long. Dinosaurs held sway for 100 million years
while mammals, all the while, lived as small animals in
the interstices of their world. After 70 million years on
top, we mammals have an excellent track record and
good prospects for the future, but we have yet to dis-

80 play the staying power of dinosaurs.

People, on this criterion, are scarcely worth men-

tioning—S million years perhaps since Australopithecus,

a mere 50,000 for our own species, Homo sapiens. Try

the ultimate test within our system of values: Do you

85 know anyone who would wager a substantial sum even at

favorable odds on the proposition that Homo sapiens will
last longer than Brontosaurus?

31. In the context of the passage as a whole, it is most rea-
sonable to infer that the phrase “the Brontosaurus that
wallowed in its pond a generation ago is now running
on land” (lines 16~18) means that:

A. the Brontosaurus evolved from living in the water
to living on land.

B. scientists’ understanding of the Brontosaurus’s
lifestyle has changed within the last generation.

C. standard illustrations of dinosaurs still inaccu-
rately depict their lifestyles.

D. the Brontosaurus eventually learned to hold up its
own weight on land.

32. The passage suggests that some fossil evidence about
dinosaur behavior has been overlooked in the past
because scientists:

F. had preconceived ideas about the intelligence of

dinosaurs.

G. believed that mammals were not capable of social
formations.

H. did not have the current data about dinosaur brain
size.

J. did not have the necessary equipment to discover
the social patterns of dinosaurs.

33. What does the passage offer as evidence that dinosaurs
may have exhibited complex behaviors?

A. Modern anatomical reconstructions indicating
strength and agility

B. Fossils revealing that dinosaurs labored under
severe burdens

C. Footprints of varying sizes indicating that
dinosaurs traveled with advanced herbivorous
mammals

D. Multiple trackways in which footprint size and
location indicate social order

34. In the context of the passage, what does the author
mean when he states that “people . . . are scarcely
worth mentioning” (lines 81-82)?

F. Compared to the complex social behavior of
dinosaurs, human behavior seems simple.

G. Compared to the longevity of dinosaurs, humans
have been on earth a very short time.

H. Compared to the size of dinosaurs, humans seem
incredibly small.

J. Compared to the amount of study done on
dinosaurs, study of human behavior is severely
lacking.

35. According to the passage, what is the revisionist inter-
pretation concerning the relationship between intelli-
gence and physical size?

A. Dinosaurs actually had relatively large brains.
B. Dinosaurs were paragons of intellect.

C. Dinosaurs were relatively small brained.

D. Dinosaurs’ brains were appropriately sized.

36. What does the author suggest in lines 34-38 when he
states that Stegosaurus has a small brain from “our
subjective, top-heavy perspective”?

F. Humans are unusually smart in their judgment of
other species.

G. The human physical construction is deformed by
the largeness of the skull.

H. It is unfair to judge other species by human
standards.
J. Not all species have a brain as small relative to

body weight as do humans.

37. The passage states that the ratio of brain weight to
body weight in larger animals, as compared to smaller
animals, is:

G.

The brain grows at two-thirds the rate of body
growth.

At maturity, the brain weighs an average of one-
third of body weight.

Large animals are not consistently less intelligent
than smaller animals.

Brain size is independent of body size.

The author states that the best illustration of dinosaurs’
capability is their dominance of the earth for:

Passage |

Flood basalt plateaus are large areas of Earth’s
surface covered with thick hardened lava. It has been
hypothesized that the huge outpourings of lava that formed
these plateaus were produced by plumes of molten material
rising from deep within Earth.

Study 1

A model of a typical plume was created using a com-
puter. It was hypothesized that the “head” of the plume
produced the flood basalt plateaus when its molten material
reached the surface. Figure | shows the computer-generated
plume, its diameter, and how long, in millions of years
(Myr), it would take the head of the plume to reach the
surface.

Study 2

Four flood basalt plateaus (A-D) were studied. The
lava volume, in cubic kilometers (km*), was estimated for
each plateau from the area of the plateau and the average
thickness of the lava. The length of time lava was being
produced at each plateau, and the rate of lava production,
in km” per year, were also estimated. The results are in
Table 1.

Study 3

Scientists found that 3 large extinctions of marine
organisms had ages similar to those of the formation of 3
of the flood basalt plateaus; 58 Myr, 66 Myr, and 133 Myr.
It was hypothesized that the production of large amounts of
lava ‘and gases in the formation of plateaus may have con-
tributed to those extinctions.

(Note: All of these ages have an error of +1 Myr.)

Passage Ill

Solids, liquids, and gases usually expand when
heated. Three experiments were conducted by scientists to
study the expansion of different substances.

Experiment 1

The apparatus shown in Diagram | was used to mea-
sure the linear expansion of wires of the same length made
from different metals. In each trial, a wire was connected
to a voltage source, run through a series of pulleys, then
attached to a weight. The temperature of the wire was
varied by changing the amount of voltage applied. The
amount of expansion is directly proportional to the rotation
of the final pulley. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Passage VI

Two students explain why the smoke (a mixture of
gases and carbon particles) from burning wood in a fire-
place rises up the chimney from the fireplace. They also
discuss how chimney efficiency (the volume of smoke
flowing out the top of the chimney per second for a given
temperature difference between inside and outside the
chimney) is related to chimney height.

Student 1

Smoke rises because the gases from burning wood are
less dense than the air that surrounds the fireplace. Because
the gases are hotter than the air, the gas molecules have a
higher average speed than the air molecules. Consequently,
the average distance between adjacent gas molecules is
greater than the average distance between adjacent air mol-
ecules, and so the gas density is less than the air density.
As a result, the upward buoyant force acting on the gases is
stronger than the downward force of gravity acting on the
gases, and the gases rise, carrying the carbon particles with
them. The upward flow of smoke is maintained as new air
enters the fireplace, causing more wood to burn.

As chimney height increases, efficiency increases.
The taller the chimney, the greater the volume of hot gas,
the stronger the buoyant force compared with the force of
gravity, and the more rapidly smoke rises.

Student 2

Smoke rises because wind blows across the top of the
chimney. When no wind is blowing, the air pressure at the
bottom of the chimney is slightly higher than the air pres-
sure at the top of the chimney. However, when air at the
top of the chimney moves at a higher speed than air at the
bottom of the chimney, the pressure difference between the
bottom and the top of the chimney is so great that air is
forced upward, carrying smoke with it. The departure of air
from the bottom of the chimney, in turn, creates a pressure
difference that forces new air into the fireplace, causing
further burning and an upward flow of smoke.

As chimney height increases, efficiency increases.
Generally, wind speed increases with altitude. The taller
the chimney, the greater the difference in air speed, the
greater the difference in air pressure, and the more rapidly
smoke rises.

198

28. According to Student 1, which of the following quanti-
ties is Jess for the gases from burning wood than for
the air that surrounds the fireplace?

F. Average speed of the molecules

G. Average distance between adjacent molecules
H. Density

J. Temperature

29, When wood was burned in 2 fireplaces that differ only
in the height of their chimneys (keeping the same tem-
perature difference between inside and outside each
chimney), Chimney Y was found to be more efficient
than Chimney X. What conclusion would each student
draw about which chimney is taller?

A. Both Student 1 and Student 2 would conclude that
Chimney X is taller.

B. Both Student | and Student 2 would conclude that
Chimney Y is taller,

C. Student 1 would conclude that Chimney X is
taller; Student 2 would conclude that Chimney Y
is taller.

D. Student 1 would conclude that Chimney Y is
taller; Student 2 would conclude that Chimney X
is taller.

30. Which student(s), if either, would predict that smoke
from burning wood will rise up the chimney from a
fireplace on a day when the air at the top of the
chimney is NOT moving?

F. Student | only

G. Student 2 only

H. Both Student 1 and Student 2
J. Neither Student 1 nor Student 2

31. When wood is burned in a fireplace, air in the fire-
place, as well as gases from the burning wood, rises up
the chimney. Student 1 would most likely argue that
the air in the fireplace rises because the air is:

A. hotter than the gases from the burning wood.
B. cooler than the gases from the burning wood.
C. hotter than the air that surrounds the fireplace.
D. cooler than the air that surrounds the fireplace.

32. When the air inside a particular hot-air balloon cooled,
the balloon and its inside air descended. Based on
Student 1’s explanation, the reason the balloon and its
inside air descended is most likely that the:

F. downward buoyant force acting on the balloon and
its inside air was stronger than the upward force of
gravity acting on the balloon and its inside air.

G. upward buoyant force acting on the balloon and its
inside air was stronger than the downward force of
gravity acting on the balloon and its inside air.

H. downward force of gravity acting on the balloon
and its inside air was stronger than the upward
buoyant force acting on the balloon and its
inside air.

J. upward force of gravity acting on the balloon
and its inside air was stronger than the down-
ward buoyant force acting on the balloon and its
inside air.

Passage VII

Salts containing nitrite ions (NO, ) are often added to
meats to prevent discoloration caused by air and bacterial
growth. Use of NO, is controversial because studies have
linked NO, with cancer. Students performed 2 experi-
ments to measure NO, levels.

Experiment 1

Four solutions, each containing a different amount
of NaNO, (a salt) in HO were prepared. A coloring agent
was added that binds with NO, to form a purple compound
that strongly absorbs light of a specific wavelength, and
each solution was diluted to 100 mL. A blank solution was
prepared in the same manner, but no NaNO, was added. A
colorimeter (a device that measures how much light of a
selected wavelength is absorbed by a sample) was used to
measure the absorbance of each solution. The absorbances
were corrected by subtracting the absorbance of the blank
solution from each reading (see Table 1 and Figure 1).

Experiment 2

A 100 g meat sample was ground in a blender with
50 mL of H,O and the mixture was filtered. The blender
and remaining meat were then washed with H,O, these
washings were filtered, and the liquid was added to the
sample solution. The coloring agent was added and the
solution was diluted to 100 mL. The procedure was
repeated for several meats, and the absorbances were mea-
sured (see Table 2),

Based on the results of Experiment 1, if a solution with
a concentration of 1.5 ppm NO, had been tested, the
corrected absorbance would have been closest to which
of the following values?

A. 0.15
B. 0.23
Cc. 0.30
D. 0.36
If Experiments | and 2 were repeated using a different

coloring agent that produces a different color when it
binds with NO, , then which of the following changes
in procedure would be necessary?

F. The new coloring agent should be added to the
blank solution, but not to the sample solutions.

G. Both of the coloring agents should be added to the
blank solution and to all of the samples.
H. The absorbance of the blank solution made with

the new coloring agent should be added to the
measured absorbances.

J. The colorimeter should be set to measure at a dif-
ferent wavelength of light.

39. Based on the results of Experiments | and 2, if the

40.

measured absorbances for the meats tested in
Experiment 2 were compared with their corrected
absorbances, the measured absorbances would be:

A. higher for all of the meats tested.

B. lower for all of the meats tested.

C. lower for some of the meats tested, higher for
others.

D. the same for all of the meats tested.

If some of the water-soluble contents found in all of
the meats tested in Experiment 2 absorbed light of the
same wavelength as the compound formed with NO.
and the coloring agent, how would the measurements
have been affected? Compared to the actual NO,” con-
centrations, the NO, concentrations apparently mea-
sured would be:

F. higher.

G. lower.

H. the same.

J. higher for some of the meats, lower for others.

Practice Writing Test Prompt i

In some states, legislators have debated whether teenagers
should be required to maintain a “C” grade average in school
before receiving a driver’s license. Some people think this
would be a good policy because having passing grades shows
that students are responsible enough to be good drivers. Other
people think such a policy would not be appropriate because
they see no relationship between grades in school and driving
skills. In your opinion, should teenagers be required to maintain
a “C” average in school before receiving a driver’s license?

In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write
about cither one of the two points of view given, or you may
present a different point of view on this question. Use specific
reasons and examples to support your position.
