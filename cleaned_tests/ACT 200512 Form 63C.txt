Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from David
Leavitt's novel Equal Affections (©1989 by David Leavitt).

Nine mysterious and crucial years separated
April’s birth from Danny’s. This‘ meant that when
Danny was’ nine, his sister was eighteen and had lived
twice as long in. the world as he had.. The difference
never seemed so vast, so insurmountable, as it did that
magical year, for as they: got older, nine years became
less of a gulf and more of a bridge. Danny met and
befriended people older than April all the time now, as
peers, a fact the nine-year-old baby brother in him still
couldn’t help but. marvel at; when he was a child, she
and her friends had seemed so immutably older than he
was. Now people. April’s age worked under him.

April and bis parents had been a family long

before he came along; they shared with each other elab-

15 orate and entrenched rituals, masses of common his-
tory, so much that in his early childhood he was always
having to ask questions: What is the house in this pic-
ture? Our old.house, where we lived in Boston, when

,. April was born. Who are these women holding babies?
20 That is your grandmother, who you never knew, holding
your cousin Joanne. And that is your aunt Eleanor,
holding your cousin Markie. And that is your mommy,
holding your sister. He studied the photographs, memo-
rizing the faces he would never see in real life, because
the people they belonged to were dead or had aged
beyond the point of recognition. It was like homework,
like memorizing the parts of the body or the capitals.
But the pictures he paid closest attention to were the
ones his patents had taken when April was a baby.
There were hundreds of them—ten or twenty taken on a
single day, sometimes, marked and dated and cap-
tioned, as:if Louise and Nat had been under some sort
of picture-taking enchantment, brought on by the mira-
cle of first birth. “11/22/52: Mommy giving April her
bottle.” “11/23/52: Daddy puts April in ‘her bath.”
Danny didn’t know this energetic young couple, busily
engaged in the rittals of baby care, and yet there were
his father’s ringed eyes and sharp nose on the face of
that skinny boy; there was his mother’s slightly
40 upturned lip, her blazing dark eyes. What surprised him
most was a sequence of pictures taken on the beach.
The color in these pictures had faded, and so the beach
had a bleached, white aspect, the bright flowers on

Louise’s bathing suit fading, as if at the end of their
season.

As April grew, as her unspecified baby face took
on the familiar features of his sister, the gaps between
when the pictures were taken grew as well, until instead
of every day, it was every six months, and then every
year, at her birthday party. Then there were no dates.
Then there were no more binders, just an old shoebox
filled with snapshots. Very few pictures existed of
Danny’s own babyhood, and when he once asked his
mother why, she looked at him strangely and put her
hand on her forehead. “Oh, Danny,” she said, laughing
a little. “I’m sorry.” He hadn’t, until that moment,
thought of it as anything to apologize for.

When Danny was growing up, he had a red rubber
ball he liked to’bounce. After school, in the afternoon,
he’d walk for hours, bouncing this ball, spinning out in
his head the plots of imaginary movies and television

shows, and tater, wl ging, making up

hen Aprit started sim;

songs, She had told him that if he wrote a song good
enough, she would sing it. But somehow it was always
someone else’s tune he came up with duting those pre-
dusk hours he spent outdoors, -bouncing, bouncing.
When. he started. college, that familiar, thunking beat
was what Louise said she missed most; she couldn’t
stand the silence, she told Danny, and joked about
paying a neighborhood child to play handball against
her garage. And later, when he was living in the East
and went home for visits, he’d find the red ball waiting
for him on his bed, and sometimes, when he had some-
thing to think through, he’d take it up and bounce it,
though it was soft where once it had been tight, and rid-
dled with tiny, unsealable holes. Louise, doing the
dishes or ironing, felt a rare peacefulness come over her
as she listened to that familiar thumping of her son and
his ball outside.

Danny remembered those hours bouncing the ball
as ones of supreme contentment and security. He had a
vision, sometimes, of Wall Street at rush hour, men in
business suits, women in pastel-colored’ tennis shoes,
but not hurrying as usual toward the subway; instead,
they are just shuffling along, bouncing, and in the
world there is a sound like thunder as a thousand balls
hit the pavement at once, fly again into the air, at once.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the revised
second edition of Demystifying Economics by Allen W. Smith
(©2000 by Allen W. Smith). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
the total dollar value of all goods and services produced in a
year’s time.within a country’s borders.

Economists usually define fiscal policy as the
deliberate use of government’s spending ‘and taxing
powers to influence economic activity. When the goy-
ernment raises or lowers taxes, or changes its spending
levels, in order to,bring about a desired change in the
level of total spending, and thus the performance of the
economy, it is practicing fiscal policy. Fiscal policy can
also be defined more generally as simply the govern-
ment’s taxing and spending policies regardless of
whether or not it is trying to bring about changes in the
level of total spending in the economy.

a

. 65

The origin of fiscal policy as a tool to bring about *

deliberate changes in the performance of the economy
dates back to 1936 when a British economist, John
Maynard Keynes, published a monumental book, The
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.
Keynesian economics soon became the predominant
body of economic theory in the Western world.
Although his theories have undergone substantial
refinement and revision, much of modern Keynesian
economics is still rooted in the ideas'set forth by
Keynes. Keynes argued that government should play an
active role in maintaining the proper level of total
spending in the economy in order to minimize both
unemployment and inflation. He believed that, with the
proper use of the government’s spending and taxing
powers, the extremes of the business cycle could be
avoided, :

15

25

The extremes of the business cycle, which result in

costly. During a severe recession, millions of workers
become unemployed, and billions of dollars worth of
potential production are permanently lost. In addition,
prolonged periods of high inflation can have a devastat-

35 ing effect on both the economy and the people. -

The objectives of deliberate fiscal policy are to
minimize unemployment and inflation by using the
government’s taxing and spending powers to assure the
correct Jevel of total spending, and thus the proper level
of Gross Domestic Product. The’ principal determinant
of the level of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the
level of total spending in the economy. If the GDP is
too high, the economy will experience inflation, and if

40

high unemployment or high inflation, can be very ~

it is too low, the economy will suffer from unemploy- *

ment. Therefore, in order to have a healthy economy, it
is important to have the proper amount of total spend-
ing so the GDP will be neither too high nor too low. .

45

Fiscal policy can be used to regulate the level of
total spending. If total spending is too high, the govern-
ment can lower its own spending and/or increase taxes
so consumers will have less after-tax money to spend.
If total spending is too low, the government can

50

ACT-630

32

increase its own spending and/or reduce taxes, so con-
sumers will have more after-tax money to spend. At
least in theory, fiscal policy can be used to regulate the
level-of total spending, and thus the level of production.
If GDP could be maintained at the appropriate level, it
would be possible to avoid both high inflation and seri-
ous unemployment.

60 One example of successful use of fiscal-policy is
the long petiod of economic expansion during the
1960s. When President John F. Kennedy took office in
1961, the economy was suffering from a recession that
had begun in 1958. Kennedy. brought into his adminis-
tration economic advisers who were determined to use
fiscal policy to bring thé economy out of the recession.
The first fiscal-policy measures included increased fed-
eral spending on highways, and legislation that allowed
businesses to subtract'fromi their taxes a part of the cost
70 of new investment in factories and machines.

When these measures proved insufficient, the
President proposed a major tax cut. Although President
Kennedy was assassinated before the tax cut was
enacted, his successor, Lyndon Johnson, signed an
$11 billion tax cut into law in February 1964. This large
tax cut, along with substantial increases in spending for
the Vietnam War, fueled an economic expansion that
lasted 106 consecutive months. .

75

Fiscal policy does not have such a good track
record in combating inflation, however: The problem is
not that proper-fiscal policies cannot successfully con-
trol inflation. The problem is the political feasibility of
getting the President and Congress to. support the
proper fiscal policies during periods of inflation.
Higher taxes and cuts in government programs are
never popular with the public, and many politicians do
not have the guts to do what is right for the economy
because such unpopular actions’ might cost them votes.

Louise Erdrich (©2001 by The Atlantic Monthly Group). Erdrich,
of French, German, and Ojibwe ancestry, is the author.of sev-
eral novels, two children’s: books, and a memoir.

Bacon: Could you talk about the-role humor plays in
Ojibweniowin, the language spoken by your mother’s
tribe? And what about the role it plays in your fiction?

Erdrich: Ojibwemowin is a maryel; the more I know
the less I know I know. Words are constantly in a state
of flux and invention, and a fluent speaker can inject
humor into any subject or situation. For instance, a
friend of mine in describing a baby’s frustration’ over
not being nursed combined, nishka (angry) and dodosh
(milk) to make a word that translates as “milk rage”—
nishkadodosh. I'll always be a beginner in this lan-
guage, as it is surely one of the most complex on earth.
As for humor in my fiction, I hope it’s there. It’s impos-
sible to write about Native life without bumor—that! Ss
how people maintain sanity.

Bacon: How‘has learning Ojibwemowin changed the
way you think about English? -

Erdrich: For one thing, I’ve noticéd English ‘is
extremely gender-based. There is no his or her in
Ojibwe. English doesn’t have the flexibility .of true
spoken Ojibwe. Because it has been written and scruti-
nized and coded a person can’t (or people usually
don’t) make up words right on the spot, as can happen
easily in a language based on oral tradition. But English
is also a big, gobbling, greedy, thorny language, and a
gift to writers because it absorbs all comers and yet
retains its most ancient self.

Bacon: Do you feel any pressure to write about certain
themes because people think of you as a Native Ameri-
can writer? As more Native Americans have begun
publishing books, do you feel freed in any way?

Erdrich: Anything I write about comes from inside and
not outside pressure. Nothing works on paper unless I
feel absolutely compelled to write it, and some of what
Lwrite as a consequence may work politically and emo-
tionally, or it simply may not.

I do feel pleased that many other Native people are
writing books, extending the view of what a Native
person is, and introducing the idea of tribal literature.
Not “Native” literature, but literature based in one
tribal vision. For instance, Ojibwe literature is very dif-
ferent from Lakota, or Zuni, or Santa Clara,Pueblo, or

Ho-Chunk, or Mesquakie literature. Each is based in”

an extremely specific tradition, history, religion,
worldview.

Bacon: You return to the same characters over and over
again, looking at their lives from different perspectives,
telling their stories in different ways. Do your charac-
ters ever surprise you?

avgy-actexam.net

50 Erdrich: Yés, I am often surprised. I have no explana-
tion for why my characters continue on with me beyond
the fact of my own consciousness. It must contain these
people—at all ages, in situations that become accessi-
ble to me over time. Fiijgen years isn’t long for a writer

55 to continue with her characters. I’m working on one big
continuous novel anyway. All of the books are part of
it.

Bacon: In your books you have written about love of

God, of music, of land, of children, of culture, among
60 many other kinds. If one thing could be said to tie your

work together, would it be the myriad forms of love?

Erdrich: I wouldn’t mind that being said, although one
could also point out that the work is also tied together
by the unity of place, or by the failure of love to solve
65 people’s lives, or by the despérate wish to be back in
our.parents’ arms, or to bé home, or by the dreadful'and
persistent longing to know why we are on earth.

Bacon: Do you see yourself as a “re-storier” for the
Ojibwe—a reclaimer of narratives that were never writ-
70 ten down or were drowned out?

Erdrich: The Ojibwe have been telling stories through
and in spite of immense hardship. In fact, Ojibwe narra-
tive has grown rich and subtle on the ironies of conflict.
But these are the narratives Qjibwe people tell among
75 themselves, and in Ojibwemowin. I wouldn’t éven
begin to think of myself as a “re-storier” in that sense. I
write in English, and so I suppose I function as an emis-
sary of the. between-world, that increasingly common
margin where cultures mix and collide. That is in fact
80 where many of my stories occur.

Primarily, though, I am just,a storyteller, and I take
them where I find them. I love stories whether they
function to reclaim. old narratives: or occur sponta-
neously. Often, to my surprise, they do both. I’ll follow

85 an inner thread of a plot and find that I am actually
retelling a very old story, often in a contemporary. set-
ting. I usually can’t recall whether it is something I
remember hearing, or something I dreamed, or read, or
imagined on the spot. It all becomes confused and then

90 the characters take over, anyway, and make the piece
their own.

21. In her questions, Bacon presents herself as being most
interested in:

A. Erdrich’s connections to het Ojibwe heritage and
the reoccdrring elements in her work.

B. the characteristics of Ojibwemowin and what
Erdrich has learned from studying it.

C. the role of humor in modern fiction aid Erdrich’s
evaluation of several prominent Native writers.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from Ancient

Trees: Trees That Live for a Thousand Years by Anna:
Lewington and Edward Parker (01999 by Anna Lewington and ”

Edward Parker).

Giant redwoods and their close ancestors have
been on the earth for at least 200 million years and, like
their coastal cousins, once.formed massive forests
across the northern hemisphere. Today they are a truly
relict species, occurring only in isolated groves on the
western slopes of the Sierra Nevada in California. -

a

Although the largest giant redwood in existence
does not hold any records for being the oldest, tallest or
broadest tree in the world, nothing can match its sheer

10 volume. The tree known as the General Sherman, after
the famous general in the American Civil War, contains
_ an estimated 50,000 cu ft/1,415 cu m of wood. The
largest trunk of any redwood is found on a tree in Alder
Creek, which averages 53 ft/16 m around its base.
45 Giant redwoods are virtually indestructible because
they have fire-resistant bark. In fact, the trees need the
clearing effect of forest fires to establish new seedlings
successfully. They aré also resistant to fungi and wood-
boring insects. The main cause of death is being blown

20 over.

Today there are just seventy-five groves of giant
redwoods left, concentrated in the. King’s Canyon and
Sequoia National Parks, with a further three groves
located in Yosemite. Where they do appear, the red-

25 wood forests seem to be healthy and reproducing well.
Giant redwood groves are found only on thé slopes of
upland ridges between major river canyons at
4,000-8,000 ft/1,220-2,440 m above sea-level. Here
the climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and

30 sunny winters. The latter are, however, interrupted by
infrequent snowstorms, which may last from a few days
to a week, leaving several feet of snow. The groves are
‘generally tucked away from areas of high wind, but
lightning strikes and’ thunderbolts are relatively

35 common. Just why the giant redwoods are confined to
isolated groves remains a mystery. Not a single tree is
found outside these, groves, even where the same cli-
matic conditions prevail.

The giant redwood has cinnamon-coloured bark,
which may grow to a massive 18 in/45 cm thick. Unlike
the slim, tapering trunk of the coast redwood, the
giant’s trunk is conical in shape and has a broad base
that can reach over 40 ft/12 m across. Even at
200 ft/60 m above the ground, it can still be more than
45 20 ft/6 m in diameter. Its main branches may grow to

* more than 8 ft/2.4 m wide, making the tree’s biggest
limbs the size of-large trées themselves.

Al

fo)

The tree stands on a shallow but widely spreading

root-pad, which can be enormous, radiating from the

50 trunk for up to 300 ft/91 m, but seldom reaching down
into the earth more than 6 ft/1.8 m. Giant redwoods
reach their maximum height in the first 500 years of
their life, after which lateral expansion goes on for at

ACT-63C

“least 3,000 years, It is not clear when a redwood stops

+ §8 expanding, because there is no definite record of any

giant redwood dying of old age and they continue to
grow indefinitely until a natural disaster, such as a
lightning strike or storm-force wind, occurs. The great-
est age that has been verified from a stump by:‘its tree

60 rings is 3,200 years. However, naturalist John Muir
claimed to have discovered’ a stump containing
4,000 rings. .

The giant redwoods start to prodiice seeds after
only a few years of life. Mature trees generate about
65 600 new cones every year and, since each cone contains
several hundred healthy seeds, a tree cam produce more
than 100,000 seeds annually. The largest giant redwood
produces some 10,000 cones and as many as two mil-
lion seeds each year. The cones do not simply fall, how-
70 ever, and release their seeds. ThisgPunction is often
performed unwittingly by the chickaree, or Douglas
squirrel, which finds the fleshy scales of the cones deli-
cious. As it feeds on them, the seeds are scattered onto
the forest floor. Once the seeds reach the ground, they

75 will germinate only. under exactly the right conditions.

. The sugar pines and yellow pines that, along with
the redwoods, form the mixed conifer forests of the
Sierra Nevada, all rely on fire to create gaps.in. the
overhead canopy and clear the forest floor. The fires

80 also dry the redwood cones on higher branches, which
then release their seeds onto the cooling ashes below.
-The action of the fires allows the seeds to fall on areas
ofibare mineral soil, where the sunlight is able to filter
through. Where fires have been prevented, the forest

85 floor rapidly becomes colonized by shade tolerant
white firs and incense cedars, hindering redwood
regeneration.

A. argue that greater conservation efforts need to, be
undertaken to protect the! giant redwood. g

B. give an overview of the giant redwood, focusing

The student concluded that at a given concentration,

. acetone causes more membrane disruption than does

methanol. Is this conclusion supported by the results of
Experiments 2 and 3 ? .

F. No, because at each concentration tested, more
betacyanin was released in the acetone solution
than was released in the methanol solution.

G. No, because at each concentration tested, less
betacyanin was released in. the acetone solution
than was released in the methanol solution.

H. Yes, because at each concentration tested, more
betacyanin was feleased in the acetone solution
than was released in the methanol solution.

J. Yes, because at each concentration tested, less
betacyanin was released in the acetone solution
than was released in the methanol solution.

Suppose that in Experiment 1, betacyanin concentra-
tion was directly proportional to absorbance. Accord-
ingly, the betacyanin concentration in the sample in
Trial 7 was most likely twice as great as the betacyanin
concentration.in the sample in:

Passage IV

Compost consists largely of organic matter that has
been decomposed by bacteria that require oxygen. Com-
post is used as soil fertilizer. Two studies were done to
examine the effect of compost use on the growth and yield
of bean plants. al

Study I &

Four different materials were selected for compost-
ing—coffee grounds, pine needles, crushed eggshells, and
alfalfa (a plant). Each material was placed in a separate
container. A small amount of distilled water was. added
to each material. The 4 containers were then left in a
warm location for about a week to allow the materials to
decompose. During the week, the materials were stirred
periodically and moistened with distilled water. The
decomposition process was considered complete when the
temperature at the center.of the material had risen to 40°C.
For each type of compost, the pH, and the nitrogen, phos-
phorus, and potassium contents were then determined (see
Table 1). '

Compost type pH | nitrogen | phosphorus | potassium

Alfalfa 6.5 3:5 0.7 1.2
Study 2

Each type of compost was added to 2 different
amounts of a given soil to create mixtures that were either
20% compost or 50% compost. A ninth mixture contained
10% pine needles, 50% crushed eggshells, 20% alfalfa, and
20% soil. Each mixture was used to fill 5 pots. Ten bean
seeds were planted in each pot. All pots received the same
amount of light and distilled water. After 6 weeks, the
number of mature bean plants growing in the pots and the
number of bean pods on each plant were counted for éach.

plants for each mixture is shown in Table 2. Figure f

plants from at least 75% of the planted seeds.

D.. No; coffee grounds had the highest percent nitro-

Based on.the description of Study 1, as organic matter
decomposes, which of the following changes takes
place?

’ F. The phosphorus content of the material being com-

posted decreases.

G. The phosphorus content of the material being com-
posted increases.

H. The temperature of the material being composted
decreases;

J. The temperature of the material being composted
increases.

The primary purpose of stirring the materials in Study 1
was to:

A. lower the pH of the materials.

B. raise the pH of the materials.

C. decrease the amount of oxygen in the materials.
D. increase the amount of oxygen in the materials.

It is known that bean plants must receive some potas-
sium from the surrounding material in order to grow to
maturity. Based on the results of Study 1, in Study 2,
the mature bean plants in mixtures containing pine
needles most likely obtained the required potassium

Passage VII 4

Students dissolved ammonium chloride (NH,Cl)
and silver.cyanate (AgOCN) together in water. A solid,
Product 1 (P1), formed and was isolated. Product 2 (P2)
was then recoyered from the water in the solution. Samples
of the products had the properties listed below:

P1: Melting point > 400°C; hard and brittle; not
soluble in water; not flammable; formula unknown

P2: Melting point =132°C; soft and nonbrittle;
soluble in water; flammable; formula is CH,N,O

Two students discuss the identity of these products.

Student 1

NH,Cl and AgOCN both are salts. Salts are composed
of: positively charged cations and negatively charged
anions: that hold together because they have opposite
charges. When salts dissolve in water, they dissociate, or
break apart, into anions and cations. When NH,CI and
AgOCN are dissolved in water, the following occurs:

NH,Cl + AgOCN > NH, + CI’ + Ag* + OCN™

The ions in solution then form new salts, silver chloride
(AgCl) and ammonium cyanate (NH,OCN):

NH, + CI + Ag'+OCN — AgCl+NH,OCN’*

P1 is AgCl: AgCl is insoluble in water, and salts tend to be
hard and brittle, to be nonflammable, and to have, high
melting points. P2is NH,OCN, which is a salt composed of
an.ammonium ion and a cyanate ion:

[NH,*][OCN"] °

This sample of NH,OCN is-soft and nonbrittle because it
absorbed water from the air after it was isolated. This also
caused the melting point to bé lower than expected for a
salt.

Student 2
Pi is AgCl, but P2 is not a salt. Ammonium ions do
react with cyanate ions to form NH,OCN, but this com-
+ pound is unstable. To isolate P2, the solution was heated at
70°C to remove the water. This caused the salt to rearrange
and form a more stable. covalent compound. In a covalent
compound, the atoms are held together by bonds, not by
their opposite charges. P2 is urea, which has the following

structure:

H.N~. NE).

50

Covalent compounds are generally not as brittle as salts.
and tend to have lower melting points. Also, covalent com-
pounds are much more likely to be, flammable than are
salts. Urea is also a compound that is found in mammalian
urine, so it must be soluble in water.

34. A compound is hygroscopic if it absorbs water from
the air. According to Student 1’s hypothesis, which of
the following compounds is hygroscopic?

F. Urea

G. AgCl

H. NH.CI

J. NH,OCN
35. Which of the students’ hypotheses, if either, would be
‘weakened if it were determined that P1 was NOT AgCl ?

A. Student 1’s only

B. Student 2’s only *

C.. Both Student 1’s and Student 2's
D. Neither Student 1’s nor Student 2’s

ing compounds represents a possible structure for P2"?

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw.Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score, Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
soores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
‘range of raw scores that includes it In the table below. Then,
read across to either outside.column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you deter-
mine your scale scores, enter them in the: blanks provided on
the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is 36.

' The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked ariy responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To.do this, add your four:scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole.number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest possi-
ble Composite score is 1. 5

- Composite score (sum + 4)
