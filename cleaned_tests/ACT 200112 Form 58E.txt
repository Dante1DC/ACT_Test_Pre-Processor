ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In the
right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE!

The following paragraphs may or may not
be in the most logical order. Each paragraph is
numbered in brackets, and question 14 will ask

‘ou to choose where Paragraph 3 should most
logically be placed.

Walking my dog, I find the beach is no longer deserted:

The town itself seems it has been held in its breath in
expectation of summer activity.

During the summer months, the strects and shops and
boardwalk are crowded with tourists buying sunscreen,
postcards, and souvenirs. It is pleasant to see vacationers
enjoying my hometown so much, and yet there is a part of
me that feels they are invading it. Everywhere I go, it is
noisy and crowded: the beach, the grocery store, the movie
theater. I find myself looking forward to the time when my
dog and I will be the only ‘one’s on the beach again. I can’t
wait to hear sea gulls crying and waves crashing instead of
people shouting and laughing. I want nothing more than to
sit alone on the beach and watch the sunset. I want nothing
less than to feel my home is someone else’s “getaway.”

PASSAGE II
Repaving Traditions

When I turned fifteen, my father and I traveled to
Mexico to visit my grandparents in Jungapeo, Michoacdn.
I had not seen Grandma and Grandpa in three veare, andI
was eager to sce them again and hear their stories about
their lives. At the same time, I felt apprehensive about the
visit. My friends had often talked about how their relatives

in Mexico chastised them for their dress and behavior. I

worried that my grandparents would be freaked by the
ways I’d changed in the past three years, or critical of the
egenerous amount of freedom to which my father had
accustomed me. Even though I was anxious, I traveled.

as a whole.

30. Suppose the writer had chosen to write about a time
when he learned an important lesson from an elder.
Would this essay successfully fulfill that goal?

F. Yes, because in the essay the narrator clearly
learns an important lesson about the relative value
of traditions from his grandparents.

G. Yes, because in the essay the narrator clearly
learns from his father the importance of respect for
his grandparents and their views.

H. ‘No, because the narrator states that traditions
should be discarded when they’ve outlived their
usefulness, and his grandparents merely agree with
this opinion,

ways in which the narrator's relationship with his
father improved when they went together to

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel The
Grass Dancer by Susan Power (©1994 by Susan Power).

It was the winter of 1928, and I was eighteen years
old. I had been snowbound for several days in my
family’s cabin and was desperate to be outdoors, where
I could work the cramps out of my legs and fill my
lungs with fresh air, I went for a long walk, fighting
through high drifts.

a

I wandered onto the leased land of the Bauer
ranch. I came to a shallow frozen pond. The ice was
uneven, marred by tangled clumps of weeds, but I
noticed a man skimming across it as if on a smooth
pane of glass. He balanced on silver blades slim as
butter knives, propelling his body forward and then
magically backward, I had heard about ice-skating, but
I'd never scen it done. [ hunched beside a frozen bush,
hoping he wouldn't notice me. But I was framed in
white and difficult to miss. The graceful man skated
toward me, and stopped so quickly his blades spit a
spray of ice. He towered over me, smiling.

“You like to dance on water?” he asked me. I
shook my head. I didn’t know what else to do. “I’m
Emery,” he said. He waited, staring directly into my
eyes, which made me uncomfortable.

3

“I'm Anna Thunder,” I finally answered.

“Now that’s a name to live up to.” He clapped his

25 large hands together. “Come here, this will be fun.”

Emery removed his skates, which I saw were metal

blades screwed onto a pair of work boots. He donned
the boots he'd been carrying and knelt in the snow.

“Give me your foot,” he said. He was the only

30 white man other than the doctor and the reservation
riest I had ever spoken to. I watched him stuff one of

his mittens in the toe of each boot and then fit the

skates on my feet. He held my hands and pulled me .

across the ice. At first I was rigid and tottered on the
slippery surface, but eventually I relaxed and pushed
off, cutting the ice with confident strokes.

Our courtship was an ice dance, and Emery’s wed-
ding present to me was my own set of silver blades he'd
ordered from the Sears catalogue.

40 Emery and I married despite disapproval from
both sides. Joyce Blue Kettle protested the loudest,
flapping her tongue so much I thought she might wear
it thin as a hair ribbon,

“People will say you're greedy,” Joyce confided to
45 me the night before my wedding.

“What do you mean?” I only half listened, dis-
tracted as I was by the last-minute details of polishing
my shoes and combing my damp hair with a clump of
sage to scent it.

50 “They say you're marrying him to get things.
What about the seven new dresses he bought you, one
for cach day of the week? What about the horsehair
sofa and brass bed? Didn't he even build you a house?”

Earlicr that day I had taken Joyce on a tour of the
55 new house, a neat clapboard structure made of planed
lumber. I felt guilty as we moved through the rooms,
the number of my possessions suddenly overwhelming
me. All my life I had been taught that material goods
were dispensable, things to be shared with friends and
family. We were not supposed to have more than we
needed, so there were endless rounds of giveaways at
our dances, where people unburdened themselves of
accumulated objects. But Emery was not Sioux, and his
affection for me resulted in lavish offerings.

65 “They know Emery has different ways,” I told her.
“Whatever you say.” Joyce shrugged.

On our first wedding anniversary, Emery and I
gave a feast for my Sioux relatives. I’d thought time
would set things right for Joyce, but she remained bitter

70 about the match. She trailed after me at the feast, and
pretended to help me in the kitchen, where she sat idle,

might be present.

accepting each other’s ways and acknowledging

others’ disapproval of those ways.

C. meeting with their families to discuss the possible
sharing of material goods.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from Morton
Hunt's The Story of Psychology (©1993 by Morton Hunt). In the
passage, the term maturation refers to the process of growth
and development, and the term perceptual ability refers to the
capacity to recognize something through the senses (sight,
small, touch, etc.).

Much maturation research is concerned with phys-
ical skills and physical attributes, and adds little to our
knowledge of the growth of the mind. But research on
the development of perceptual abilities begins to pro-
vide solid factual answers to the ancient central ques-
tion of psychology: How much is due to nature and how
much to nurture (or, in developmental terms, to matura-
tion and to learning)?

The work has been focused on early infancy, when
perceptual abilities evolve rapidly; its aim is to dis-
cover when each new ability first appears, the assump-
tion being that at its first appearance, the new ability
arises not from learning but from maturation of the
optic nervous structures and especially of that part of
the brain cortex where visual signals are received and
interpreted.

Much has been learned by simply watching
infants. What, exactly, do very young infants sec?
Since we cannot ask them what they sce, how can we
find out?

In 1961, the psychologist Robert Fantz devised an
ingenious method of doing so. He designed a stand in
which, on the bottom level, the baby lies on her back,
looking up. A few feet above is a display area where
the experimenter puts two large cards, each containing
a design—a white circle, a yellow circle, a bull’s-eye, a
simple sketch of a face. The researcher, peering down
through a tiny peephole, can watch the movement of
the baby’s eyes and time how long they are directed at
one or the other of each pair of patterns. Fantz found
that at two months babies looked twice as long at a
bull’s-eye as at a circle of solid color, and twice as long
at a sketch of a face as at a bull’s-eye. Evidently, even a
two-month-old can distinguish major differences and
direct her gaze toward what she finds more interesting.

Using this technique, developmental psychologists
have learned a great deal about what infants see and
when they begin to see it. In the first week infants dis-
tinguish light and dark patterns; during the first month
they begin to track slowly moving objects; by the
second month they begin to have depth perception,
coordinate the movement of the eyes, and differentiate
among hues and levels of brightness; by three months
they can glance from one object to another, and can dis-
tinguish among family members; by four months they
focus at varying distances, make increasingly fine dis-
tinctions, and begin to recognize the meaning of what
they see (they look longer at a normal sketch of a face
than at one in which the features have been scrambled);
and from four to seven months they achieve stereopsis,
recognize that a shape held at different angles is still

ACT.S8E

the same shape, and gain near-adult ability to focus at
varying distances.

Exactly how maturation and experience interact in
85 the brain tissues to produce such developmental
changes is becoming clear from neuroscience research,
Microscopic examination of the brains of infants shows
that as the brain triples in size during the first two years
of life, a profusion of dendrites (branches) grow from

60 its neurons and make contact with one another.

By the time a human is twelve, the brain has an
estimated hundred trillion synapses (connections
between nerve cells). Those connections are the wiring
plan that establishes the brain's capabilities. Some of

65 the synaptic connections are made automatically by
chemical guidance, but others are made by the stimulus
of experience during the period of rapid dendrite
growth. Lacking such stimulus, the dendrites wither
away without forming the needed synapses. Mice

70 reared in the dark develop fewer dendritic spines and
synaptic connections in the visual cortex than mice
reared in the light, and even when exposed to light
never attain normal vision.

Why should nature have done that? Why should
75 perceptual development be possible only at a critical
period and not later? It does not make evolutionary
sense for the organism to be permanently impaired in
sensory performance just because it fails to have the
proper experiences at specific times in its development.
80 But some brain rescarchers say that there is an offset-
ting advantage: the essential experiences are almost
always available at the right time,and they fine-tune
the brain structure so as to provide far more specific
perceptual powers than could result from genetic con-

85 trol of synapse formation. .

With that, the vague old terms nature and nurture
take on precise new meaning. Now, after so many cen-
turies of speculation, we catch the first glimpse of how
mind is constructed out of matter by expericrice.

11. The main point of the passage is that:

A. during the first four to seven months of life, babies
learn at an accelerated pace.

B. organisms deprived of critical life experiences
may or may not develop normal sensory perfor-
mance.

C. the development of perceptual abilities is the
result of the interaction between nature and experi-
ence.

D. research concerned with physical skills and abili-
ties adds little to our knowledge of the growth of
the mind. .

of perceptual abilities begins to provide solid answers
to the question: “How much is due to nature and how
much to nurture?” (lines 6-7). Does the passage con-
sistently support this assertion?

F. Yes, because according to the passage, researchers

have discovered that the brain develops through

the interaction of natural processes and the stim-

ulus of experience.

Yes, because according to the passage, current

brain research indicates that, due to rapid dendrite

growth, the brain triples in size during a person’s

first two years.

No, because the passage emphasizes the fact that

learning is fully responsible for the development

of perceptual abilities.

perceptual ability.

B. how visual signals are received in the brain cortex
of an infant.

C. how infants’ physical development affects their
emotional development.

F. Arred, white, and blue ribbon
G. A bright yellow circle

H. A sketch of a face

J. A bull's-eye

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the essay “Faith
and Work" by Scott Russell Sanders (©1995 by Scott Russell
Sanders).

The difference between a machine and a tool—
between a bread-maker and a bread pan—is that a tool
extends human skills, a machine replaces them. When
the freedom and craft have been squeezed out of work
it becomes toil, without mystery or meaning, and that is
why many people hate their jobs. You can measure the
drudgery of a job by the number of layers of supervi-
sion required to keep the wheels spinning or the cash
registers ringing. Toil drains us; but good work may

10 renew us, by giving expression to our powers.

A generation or two ago it would have seemed less
strange to relish hard work. My grandparents might
smile at the laziness of Tom Sawyer, who fooled others
into doing his chores, but they would remind you that

15 Tom was a child. Grown-ups do their own chores,

unless they are idlers, good-for-nothings, ne’er-do-
wells. Grown-ups look after their own needs, provide
for their families, help their neighbors, do something
useful. So my grandparents taught by word and
example. Any job worth doing is worth doing right,
they used to say. To try sliding by with the least effort,
my grandparents believed, was to be guilty of a sin
called sloth,

I knew this cluster of values by experience long
before I heard it referred to as the work ethic, a phrase
that has lost its edge from tumbling over the lips of too
many cynical bosses and politicians. Whatever hap-
pened to the work ethic? laments the manager who
wishes to squeeze more profit from his employees.
Whatever happened to the work ethic? groans the offi-
cial who wants to shrink the welfare rolls. As I under-
stand it, a regard for the necessity and virtue of work
has nothing to do with productivity or taxes, and every-
thing to do with fulfilling one’s humanity, As I have
seen it embodied in the lives not only of grandparents
but of parents and neighbors and friends, this ethic
arises from a belief that the creation is a sacred gift,
and that by working we express our gratitude and cele-
brate our powers. To honor that gift, we should live
simply, honestly, conservingly, saving money and
patching clothes and fixing what breaks, sharing what
we have,

Those values are under assault every minute of the
day in a consumer economy—from advertising, from

45 the glittering goodies in stores, from the luxurious

imagery of television, magazines, and films, and from a
philosophy that views the universe not as a gift to be
honored but as a warehouse to be ransacked. If money
is meaning, if winning the lottery or beating the stock

50 market defines success, if the goal of life is easy sensa-

AG’

tion, then why lift a finger so long as you can force
someone or something else to do it for you?

I can think of many reasons to lift a finger, among
them the delight in exercising skill, in sharing labor

55 with companions, in planning a task and carrying it
through, in bringing some benefit to the world. But the
chief reason for relishing work is that it allows us to
practice our faith, whatever that faith may be. The
Buddha advised his followers to seek right livelihood,
to provide for their needs in a modest and responsible
manner, with respect for other creatures, in harmony
with the way of things. We show our understanding of
the way of things by the quality of our work, whether or
not we have heard the Buddha’s teachings. The old the-
ological debate as to whether salvation is to be gained
by works or by faith begins from a false dichotomy.
Faith concerns our sense of what is real, what is valu-
able, what is holy; work is how we act out that faith.

The Shakers condensed their faith into the maxim,
70 “Hands to work, hearts to God.” Anyone who has
looked at their furniture or buildings can sense the
clarity of their vision. “One feels that for the Shaker
craftsmen,” Thomas Merton observed, “love of God
and love of truth in one’s own work came to the same
thing, and that work itself was a prayer, a communion
with the inmost spiritual reality of things and so with
God." Mother Ann Lee, who launched the Shaker
movement, counseled her followers to “Do all your
work as if you had a thousand years to live, and as you
80 would if you knew you must die tomorrow.”

7

a

If the purpose of life is not to acquire but to
inquire, to seck understanding, to discover all we can
about ourselves and the universe, to commune with the
source of things, then we should care less about what
we carn—moncy, prestige, salvation—and more about
what we learn. In light of all we have to learn, the dif-
ference between dying tomorrow and a hundred years
from tomorrow is not very great.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted from David
Quammen’s book Natural Acts: A Sidelong View of Sclence
and Nature (©1985 by David Quammen).

The concept of mind is not inappropriate as
applied to the octopi, since these creatures have by far
the most highly developed brain in their province of the
animal kingdom. They belong to the phylum Mollusca,
‘a large group of invertebrates mainly characterized by
soft bodies, hard shells, and rather primitive patterns of
anatomical organization, well suited to surviving incon-
spicuously on the sea bottom. Typical of the Mollusca
are clams, oysters, snails; the octopi (and to a lesser
10 extent their near relatives, the squids) are decidedly

untypical. They are an evolutionary anomaly, a class of
genius misfits who have advanced far beyond their
origins.

a

The octopi have an elaborate fourteen-lobed brain,
15 an organ so large that their brain-to-body-weight ratio
exceeds that of most fish and reptiles. Mentally, they
ace-more on a level with birds and mammals. They pos-
sess a capacity for learning, memory and considered
behavior that makes them—with the exception of
20 marine mammals—the most intelligent of all sea-
dwelling animals. In a laboratory, they tend to be good
at mazes, and perform well in tests of discrimination
among visual symbols. This last talent depends partly
upon their acute cycsight. Every octopus looks out at
the world through a pair of extraordinary cyes—cycs
about which, to a human, there is something unexpect-
edly and disquictingly familiar.

2

a

“The animal has eyes that stare back,” according
to Martin J. Wells, a British zoologist who is one of the
world's experts in octopus physiology and behavior. “It
responds to movement, cowering if anything large
approaches it, or leaning forward in an alert and inter-
ested manner to examine small happenings in its visual
field.” Jacques Cousteau gocs a bit further: “When a
35 diver sees a giant octopus in the dim water, its great

eyes fixed on him, he feels a strange sensation of
respect, as though he were in the presence of a very
wise and very old animal, whose tranquility it would be
best not to disturb.” One of Cousteau’s assistants adds:
40 “I have often had the impression that they are
‘reflecting.’” Other divers and lab researchers make the
same sort of comment, describing the same eerie sense
of encounter, recognition, even mutuality. Lately I've
had occasion to experience it myself, during three
evenings of octopus-watching in a small university
room filled with quietly gurgling tanks: the potent,
. expressive gaze of the octopus. These animals don’t
just gape at you glassily, like a walleye [a fish]. They
make eye contact, as though they are someone you
50 should know.

El

8

4

a

One of the reasons for the potency of that stare is
simply a matter of proportion. Relative to the body size
of a given octopus, the eyes are, like the brain, unusu-
ally large. (The ultimate record in this regard belongs to

ACT-58E

85 that octopus ‘cousin, the giant squid—with an eyeball -
up to fifteen inches across, largest on Earth and twice
the size of the eye of a blue whale.) Octopus eyes are
also protrusive and mobile, bulging up periscopically
when the creature's attention is caught, swiveling far

60 enough fore and aft to cover all 360 degrees of horizon.
But the real magic behind the octopod gaze is that those
eyes bear a startling structural similarity to our own.

It’s an exemplary instance of the phenomenon
called convergent evolution. Two separate evolutionary
65 paths are followed for millions of years by two dis-
parate groups of creatures, arriving eventually at two
separate but (coincidentally) very similar solutions to a
common problem. In this case, the problem of trans-
lating incident light rays into coherent images con-
70 veyable to the brain. The vertebrate eye—the model we
humans share with cougars and eagles and rattlesnakes,
all having inherited the pattern commonly—is an inge-
nious contrivance combining a cornea, a crystalline
lens, an adjustable iris, and a retina, That such an organ
75 evolved even once, within the vertebrate line, repre-
sents a miraculous triumph of time and trial-and-error
over improbability. The still larger miracle is that two
very similar versions have appeared independently, The
other belongs exclusively to the octopi and their close
80 kin. Each of those squid and octopus eyes consists of a
cornea, a crystalline lens, an adjustable iris, and a
retina, functioning together in much the same way as
ours.

Passage |

Concrete is a mixture of cement, water, and aggregate
(usually sand or gravel). The cement and water react chem-
ically to form a hard paste, which binds the aggregate
together.

The strength of a cylindrical sample of concrete is
measured by subjecting the sample to increasing vertical
compression until it breaks (see Figure 1). The vertical
compression needed to break the sample is called the com-
pressive strength and is measured in kg/cm’,

vertical compression

Figure 1

An engineer conducted the following studies to deter-
mine factors that affect the compressive strength of
concrete. :

Study 1

Eight groups of cylindrical concrete samples were
prepared—4 using Type I cement (Groups A-D) and 4
using Type Il cement (Groups W-Z). All samples had the
same dimensions. The water content, by weight, was the
same in each sample but the cement content, by weight,
was varied to create different water to cement ratios in
each group. Each sample contained the same type and
amount of aggregate. After the samples had been aged
(allowed to sit undisturbed) under identical conditions for
28 days, their compressive strengths were measured. The
results are shown in Table 1.

The shape of a planet's orbit around a star is elliptical.
Kepler’s third law of motion relates the planet’s orbital
period (the time the planet takes to complete one orbit) to
the ellipse’s semimajor axis, a, (see Figure 1) and the star’s
mass, Figure 2 contains a graph of the orbital period versus
a for 6 of the planets that orbit the Sun. The average orbital
speeds of these planets are plotted versus a in Figure 3.

Kepler's third law also describes a moon’s orbit
around a planet. Figure 4 contains graphs of the orbital
period versus a for moons orbiting hypothetical planets of
various masses.

Passage IV

Researchers performed the following experiments to
evaluate the effectiveness of a disinfectant (chemical)
called NoGrow (NG) at stopping bacterial growth.

Experiment 1

Equal amounts of a solution containing the bacterium
Escherichia coli (E. coli) were added to 5 test tubes. One
sample was not exposed to NG; the remaining 4 samples
were exposed to 0.1 mL of NG for different times. The
5 samples were then washed to remove the NG and incu-
bated for 24 hours at 37°C. After the 24-hour period,
researchers checked the samples for bacterial growth (see

Nemoria caterpillars that hatch in the spring mature
into a yellow, ridged morph (body type); those that hatch
in the summer mature into a gray, smooth morph.
A researcher hypothesized that caterpillar morphology
is influenced by 3 environmental factors: temperature,
photoperiod (hours [hr] of sunlight per day), and diet. He
performed 3 studies on Nemoria.

Study 1

Treatment groups (groups exposed to different experi-
mental conditions) of equal numbers were created by
varying 3 factors: temperature (15°C or 25°C), photoperiod
(12.5 hr or 14 hr), and diet (catkins [oak flower clusters] or
oak leaves). The percent of caterpillars that developed into
each morph appears in Table 1.

Passage VII

A double-stranded DNA molecule is shown in
Figure 1. Each single strand, or polynucleotide, is com-
posed of repeating subunits called nucleotides. A
nucleotide is composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and
a base, There are 4 types of bases in DNA: adenine, gua-
nine, cytosine, and thymine.

Nucleotides are joined in a ladderlike structure. The
sugars and phosphate groups form the sides of the ladder,
or backbones, while pairs of bases form the rungs. Pairing
between bases is specific: adenine always binds with
thymine, and guanine always binds with cytosine. Base
pairs are connected together with hydrogen bonds, weak
chemical bonds.

Scientists have proposed 3 models to explain how
DNA replicates.

Semiconservative Model

DNA is separated into 2 polynucleotides by breaking
the bonds between the base pairs. Each parental polynu-
cleotide serves as a template for the synthesis of a new
polvaucteotide. Each parental polynucleotide then com-

ines with the new polynucleotide synthesized from it.
Thus, after replication, each DNA molecule is composed of
a parental polynucleotide and a new polynucleotide
(Figure 2).

Figure 2

Conservative Model

DNA is separated into 2 polynucleotides by breaking
the bonds between the base pairs. Each polynucleotide
serves as a template for the synthesis of a new polynu-
cleotide. The parental polynucleotides then rejoin; the new
polynucleotides also combine. Thus, after replication,
1 DNA molccule is composed of parental DNA; the other
is composed of new DNA (Figure 3).

Key

Figure 3

Dispersive Model

DNA is separated into 2 polynucleotides by breaking
the bonds between the base pairs. Each polynucleotide is
then fragmented along the length of the sugar-phosphate
backbone into many short, single-stranded polynucleotide
fragments. Each fragment serves as a template for the syn-
thesis of a new complementary fragment. The fragments
then combine so that, after replication, each DNA molecule
contains many pieces of parental DNA and many pieces of
new DNA (Figure 4).

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any ACT Test 58E Your Scale Score
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score, Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale English
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then, Mathematics
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you determine Reading
your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided on the right.
The highest possible scale score for each test is 36. The lowest Science Reasoning
possible scale score for any test on which you marked any
responses is 1.
Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the Sum of scores
four scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and
divide the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, Composite score (sum +4)
round it off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any
fraction less than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
or more.) Enter this number in the blank. This is your do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely

The lowest possible Composite score is 1.
