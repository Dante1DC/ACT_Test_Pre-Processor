ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is, best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the altemative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |

The following paragraphs may or may not be
in the most logical order. Each paragraph is num-
bered in brackets, and question 15 will ask you to
choose where Paragraph 4 should most logically

All this made Red believe she was the top dog.

Andrew’s behavior confused Red further. Andrew left her

To visually express elements such as mood and
tone, movie directors rely on cinematographers to

work closely with them.-In this artistic field, few

cinematographers rank the higher for James Wong Howe.

To be born in China in 1899, Howe moved with his

3
family to Washington State at the age of five. During

his childhood, Howe became interested in photography.
Whihh de KER EW purchased his first camera and
taught himself to develop film. In 1916, after moving to

Los Angeles, Howe worked in a photography studio to

improve his skills in developing film and shooting
photographs.
[3]

Howe’s fifty-seven-year career in cinematography

began later, on the set of famed director Cecil B.

34
DeMille’s 1919 film Male and Female. For a scene in

which a lion attacks the film’s star, DeMille needed

the scene. DeMille, pleased with Howe's work that he
hired him as an assistant camera operator for fis next
several films.

(4)

In addition to operating movie cameras, Howe also
photographed the actors on the set. The popular actress
Mary Miles Minter discovered Howe’s talent when he
figured out how to keep her pale eyes from appearing
white in black-and-white photographs. He was soon hired
as the cinematographer for her films, which established
Howe’s reputation as an expert in the field.

[5]
~ Howe worked on over 140 films. He earned the
nickname “Low-Key Howe,” for the way he lowered the
a 0

height of studio lights to make interiors look dim and

moody. His camera work was also imaginative. During

filming for the boxing movie Body and Soul; for instance,

A Mystery at 10,000 Feet Under the Sea

In 1999, a deep-ocean exploration team conducting an
ocean-floor survey in the eastern Mediterranean Sea found
something they didn’t expect. In five places, their sonar
system detected unexplained shapes at a depth of almost
10,000 feet when it is known as the Herodotus Abyssal

%
Plain. Perplexed by the sonar data, the explorers lowered

a remote-controlled vehicle to collect at one of the sites

While legends about the lights abound,

sometimes these old tales conflict with one another.

4

For years, many people thought the lights were a
form of reflected sunlight. Then, in 1899, Norwegian
physicist Kristian Birkeland led a dangerous winter

expedition to the Arctic Circle to observe the lights.

Upon his return the following year, he became the first
6
scientist to advance a comprehensive explanation of

why auroras exist.
[3]

Birkeland posited that the lights are the result of
electrically charged particles from the Sun interacting
with Earth’s magnetic field. While most of the particles
streaming past Earth are deflected by its magnetic field,
some follow the field lines toward the poles, producing
light as they collide with oxygen and nitrogen a the
atmosphere.

{4}

Further research has refined Birkeland’s theory
regarding the magnificent light show. Auroral studies by
spacecraft have confirmed the close link between sunspot
activity and the lights. They have also shown how the
electrons that cause the northern and southern auroras
create simultaneous—often mirror-image—light shows,
one at each pole.

(5]

Many of the era’s top scientists ridiculed

co
Birkeland’s work, who scoffed at the notion

that electrons from the Sun could reach Earth’s

magnetic field from such a great-distance.

74, As a way to conclude the paragraph, the writer is con-
sidering adding the following true statement:

Of course, some people up through modern
times have claimed they can “hear” the auro-
tas, but scientists believe it’s unlikely that the
auroras themselves produce the sounds people
report.

Should the writer make this addition here?

F. Yes, because it contributes a valuable scientific
fact about the auroras to the paragraph.

G. Yes, because it logically wraps up the paragraph’s
description of the auroras’ majestic appearance.

H. No, because it clearly undermines the paragraph’s
claim that the auroras are silent.

J. No, because it raises a largely irrelevant and anti-
climactic point that weakens the paragraph.

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel
Queen of Dreams by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni (©2004 by
Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni).

The narrator of the passage is a girl named Rakhi.

My father has been telling us stories all week,
while he tries out snacks and sweets on us. I’m rusty, he
claims. Got to get in shape. But [ suspect he just loves
to feed us. I enjoy the snacks, but it’s the stories I really

5 crave. He has told us about his early days as a student
in America, about the odd jobs he held to make
money—a janitor in a hospital, a slot-machine repair-
man in a casino. About the people he met in these
places. I would never have guessed that such a consum-

10 mate storyteller lay waiting all these years inside my
father. He prolongs the suspense until we’re about to
shake him; he makes us burst out laughing at unex-
pected jokes. My favorite stories are about his life in
India. But so far he has not told us any stories involving

15 my mother, though he does mention her—lovingly, rue-
fully—in passing.

From time to time my father sings as he cooks,
mostly songs from the movies, though sometimes a
haunting tune that sounds far older will wind like wood
20 smoke through the store. They make me restless, these
tunes, as though there is something inside my chest that
wants to escape. There’s a feeling like pinpricks in my
fingers, a need to paint—something I haven’t been able

to do since my mother’s death.

2. When J ask, he tells me these are folk songs that
field hands sing in Bengal. He picked them up during
school holidays when he visited his uncle, who was the
subestate manager for the royal family of Nataal. I
sense a story there. No, stories tucked within the

30 envelopes of other stories, an entire post office worth of
them, filling me with giddy anticipation.

But today my father tells us this is no time for

lolling around, listening to foolish tales. Tomorrow’s a
big day. Flyers have been passed out via Marco and his

35 friends, advertisements have been placed in the East
Bay Express and India West. I’ve given in and let my
father deploy Sonny as our publicist, and he’s been

w talking up.our new concept at the nightclub. We must

be ready, my father insists. He needs to make another
batch of gawja, those crisp diamonds of fried dough
crusted with sugar. He wasn’t satisfied with the consis-
tency of the melted sugar last time. "We assure him that
the gawjas were delicious, but he shakes his head.
Nothing less than perfection will do for our grand
reopening, as he calls it. He assigns Belle the task of
writing our new menu on the board. She asks if she
should provide brief descriptions of the items, but he
says no. No pandering to tourist types here, he adds
sternly. This is a real cha shop. If people ask, you can
explain. But you'll be surprised at how much they
know already—and how much they can learn on their
own. Jespal, who has just come in, is set to dusting the
furniture. As for me, he shoos me outside to paint. The
new name has to be dry by the time we open tomorrow.
I comply, a little taken aback by his bustling, manage-
rial manner. Is there no end to the personalities hiding
inside my father’s skin? Don’t rush it, he warns as he
disappears into the back room.

I trace the letters, then begin to fill them in. Kurma
House. My father is the author of this name. I pointed
out to him that kurma is a dinner dish, something we
don’t plan to serve. He shrugged. We are artists, Rakhi,
he said loftily. Must we be bound to literalities?

The heft of the brush in my hand, heavy with
paint, feels so right. Even though this isn’t the same as

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from in Search of
America by Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster (©2002 by The
America Project, LLC)

Deep inside a five-thousand-square-foot concrete
vault, buried below the streets of West Orange, New
Jersey, lie the artifacts of one of history’s greatest
inventors: the notebooks, sketches, patents, contracts,
correspondence, invoices, prototypes, and blueprints of
Thomas Alva Edison and his legendary “invention fac-
tory.” Bob Rosenberg, the director of the Thomas A.
Edison Papers Project, says he knew relatively little
about Edison when he agreed to come here eighteen
years ago. He knows more now. But both he and Paul
Israel, his longtime colleague on this endeavor, say they
have a long way to go to fully understand the subject
that has become their life’s work.

In Edison, the historians have chosen a subject
whose image has been well kneaded by legend and wor-
ship. In the late nineteenth century, as his reputation as
an inventor of genius began to take flight, Tom Edison
had been seen as something of a mysterious figure, an
alchemist scheming in a laboratory. But once the stream
of machines began to pour forth from his first major
laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey (the phonograph,

-electric light, and an improved telephone were all

invented there), people discovered them to be the
kinds of inventions that brought them exciting new
conveniences.

Encouraged, in part, by Edison himself, who was a
terrific self-promoter, the public that had once shied
from him grew to see Edison as an American hero. Par-
ents exhorted their children to follow his credo of hard
work, perseverance, and exploration. By the 1920s,
Edison had become an American senior statesman, the
Midwestern country boy who, along with his friend
Henry Ford, built the modern American city and its
vibrant, new, electric culture. Indeed, by the twenties,
Edison could witness the extraordinary impact of his
labor: cities lit by his light, the sounds of a booming
music industry created by his phonograph, a whole new
form of popular culture—movies—established by his
motion picture camera. Death did not diminish his rep-
utation; it enhanced it. By the mid 1930s, polls
ranked Edison’s popularity near that of Lincoln and
Washington.

The best part of the Edison legend was its adven-
turous beginnings, with the young Edison leaving home
to ride the rails, selling candy and newspapers while
setting up a small lab for electrical experiments in the
baggage car. But the essence of Edison’s broader appeal
was that he had not simply been a “scientist”; he was a
peculiarly American scientist: because he was largely
self-taught, he appealed to that innate American appre-
ciation for the amateur; because he worked 112 hour
weeks (and punched a clock just like the other
workers), he confirmed the Yankee spirit for diligence
and industry; because he focused his work on applied

ACT-68C

32

55 science—inventions which had a future in the market-

place—at the expense of the theoretical, he separated
his discoveries from those that shattered popular values
and beliefs. In fact, Edison derided scientists who spent
their lives “studying the fuzz on a bee” as morally sus-

60 pect and complained when one of his sons began to

pursue theoretical physics.

By studying patents and drawings, iedger entries,
and, especially, unbound scraps of paper upon which
Edison and his associates recorded ideas in the midst of

65 research, Rosenberg and Israel have exposed some of

the innocent fictions that have developed around the
Edison story and slowly given human form to a figure
who had long been left to caricature. Yet, amazingly,
the man they have discovered is no less impressive and

70 perhaps even more representative of the national ethos.

While Europeans have always considered invention a
refined occupation, in America it was a utilitarian
activity, inspired by necessity and dedicated to results.
The papers have revealed Edison to be perhaps the most

75 representative figure of a technological style in the

belief that if science is not serving humanity it is not
worth pursuing.

By the 1970s, Edison’s name had dropped down
on the list of America’s most admired. But, perhaps

80 because the waning days of the twentieth century and

the first days of the twenty-first have defined a new
“age of invention,” one as dynamic and transforming as
the one that occurred over a hundred years ago, interest
in Edison has recently skyrocketed. Before Edison, the

85 image of the machine was as a behemoth, enslaver of

humans; with Edison, the machine became a slave
itself, to the human mind, an extension not of the mus-
cles, but of the brain, from which naturally followed
every major technological event, including the com-

90 puter. “Edison,” says Rosenberg, “was quite simply the

best inventor who ever lived.”

11. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A. describe aspects of the Edison legend and suggest
how the Edison Papers Project is contributing to a
better understanding of Edison.

B. explain exactly how Rosenberg and Israel col-
lected artifacts for the Edison Papers Project and
describe the goal of their research.

C. make clear that Rosenberg and Israel, through a
thorough study of the myths surrounding Edison,
plan to reinvent America’s image of Edison.

D. argue the merits of applied science over theoretical
science, using Edison’s approach to invention as
support.

One of the main purposes of the second and third para-
graphs (lines 14-42) is to describe how the American
public’s view of Edison evolved from:

F. slightly skeptical to reverent.

G. disdainful to almost accepting.

H. intrigued to slightly dismissive.

J. passionately critical to nearly worshipful.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that Edison criticized scientists who spent their lives
“studying the fuzz on a bee” (line 59) bécause he felt
that those scientists weren’t:

dedicated to advancing theoretical science.
focusing on shattering popular values and beliefs.
using their talents to serve human beings.
interested in sharing their research findings with
other scientists.

POP

It’s clear from the passage that Rosenberg and Israel
consider the Edison Papers Project and their study of
Edison to be:

F. completed after eighteen years of hard work and
research.

G. a work in progress that doesn’t have a definite end
point.

H. finally starting to seem worthwhile to them and to
others who are interested in Edison.

J. an overwhelming task that soon will be passed on

to a new team of historians.

The authors indicate that Americans in the early twen-
tieth century held in high regard all of the following
traits EXCEPT:

A. being committed to a job and working long hours.

amateur. .

C._ being focused on personal wealth.

D. creating marketable products.

lations as the typical U.S. worker.

C. encouraged U.S. workers to reevaluate their ideals
and habits.

The passage implies that for the purpose of demystify-
ing Edison, the most valuable Edison artifacts for
Rosenberg and Israel have been:

EF. entries in ledger books.

G. ideas written on unbound scraps of paper.
H. drafts of designs in blueprint form.

J. correspondence organized in envelopes.

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “Provi-
dential Happening” by Fred Hapgood (62002 by Smithsonian
Institution).

At dusk, a small black boat passes down a river
through the city of Providence, Rhode Island. A crew
member, dressed in black, beats slowly on a gong. Now
other black boats appear, whose black-clad crews carry
torches. Disks of fire, each about a yard across, blos-
som on the river’s surface. The flames, reaching up
from braziers that appear to float on the water, breathe
streamers of sparks into the air. Music just past the
edge of memory (African drumming, arias from half-
10 forgotten operas, Indian ragas) mixes with the sputter

and pop of burning firewood.

o

Tens of thousands of people line the riverbanks of
downtown Providence to witness the curious civic
ritual known as WaterFire, an event that occurs almost

15 every other Saturday from April to November and com-
bines avant-garde performance art with a block party.
People dance in the street to swing, salsa or tango
on some nights, but mostly they watch the mock-
mysterious spectacle of bonfires burning in a hundred

20 braziers, most of which rest on submerged floats that
are anchored to the river bottom. Seven slow-moving
boats make at least ten refueling runs from sundown to
LAM.

Depending on one’s point of view, the event

25 evokes “the spirit of elemental beauty” or is “a camp-

fire for the whole city.” What’s more, it has played an

important role in the revival of downtown, which used

to empty out in the evening. Now, on WaterFire nights

large crowds fill the city’s center. It used to be hard to

30 find anyone enjoying himself or herself on the banks of

the Providence River, night or day. Actually, it used to

be hard to find the Providence River, which had long
since been largely covered over.

WaterFire started as a “fire sculpture installation”
35 by local artist Barnaby Evans, which he first presented
in 1994, in the midst of the city’s ten-year, $40 million
effort to remove the bridges and roadways that had
obscured the Providence River and the tributaries that
feed it, the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers.
40 WaterFire is thus the most flamboyant evidence of what
urban planners call “daylighting,” the growing practice

of restoring long-obscured waterways.

Daylighting Providence’s rivers has been such a
success that practically everyone in the city is eager to

45 take credit for it. But the prime mover is generally rec-
ognized as local architect William Warner, who secured
$100,000 in funding in 1982 to study the “fantasy” (his
term) of restoring the abused waterways. By the middle

of the 20th century, Providence’s rivers had become so

50 fouled by sewage and industrial waste that the city
decked them over with highways and parking lots.
Opening the rivers, Warner argued, would create a
cityscape as friendly to pedestrians as it had been to

www.actexam.net

ACT-6aC

cars. He formed a group of civic leaders, which regaled
55 city officials and others with slide shows of what the
riverfront might look like if the rivers were exposed.

The largest urban renewal project in the city’s his-

tory involved rerouting automobile traffic and building

12 new bridges. A downstream post office at the junc-

60 tion of the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers
~ could not be moved, so the rivers were redirected.

As it happened, Evans, the artist, created his
second fire installation at an arts festival in 1996,
around the time of the daylighting project’s completion.

65 Then he kept hearing from residents who wanted to see
the piece again; it was as though they’d never noticed
the rivers before, he recalls. A nonprofit group, Water-
Fire Providence, was started to continue staging the
event. WaterFire, the Providence Journal editorialized

70 in 1997, is the most popular work of art in the city’s
history.

Does WaterFire mean anything in particular? Is it

a take-off on a religious rite? A commentary on the lack

of meaningful ritual in American life? Evans says it’s

75 open to interpretation. “It is a ritual and a ceremony

that refers to scores of religious festivals, as well as

contemporary art,” he says. “But I didn’t want all that

symbolism to get in the way of someone enjoying it
simply for the beauty of it.”

80 The music, emanating from invisible loudspeakers
alongside the rivers, seems to come not from a single
point but from all of Providence, as if the city were one
instrument. The heat from the fires, the cedar smoke
and the rhythms and chants seem to transport visitors to

85 another time and place. Around midnight, after the
crowds have drifted away, people still sit by the river-
banks, staring into the flames. Not until the fires die do
they seem to rediscover themselves, shake themselves
out and head for home.

21. The main idea of the passage is that:

A. WaterFire’s success is attributable to several indi-
viduals, but Evans deserves most of the credit.

B. WaterFire and a major urban renewal effort have
revitalized downtown Providence.

C. WaterFire’s popularity has led Providence officials
to consider supporting other public art.

D. WaterFire is a curious civic ritual whose symbolic
meaning is open to interpretation.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the essay
“Prayer Dogs” by Terry Tempest Williams (G2005 by Creative
Nonfiction Foundation).

Prairie dogs evolved in the Pleistocene era and
now represent the last of the Great Frontier. Histori-
cally, prairie dog towns followed the bison, aerating the
soil after the great stampedes. These towns could range
in size from one to one thousand acres. Many in the
Great Plains seemed to spread as far as the horizon.
Within these communities are family units called
coteries. A coterie, consisting of a single adult male,
one to four adult females, and offspring up to two years
old, can occupy a territory up to about an acre.

As above, so below. One could consider the double
life of prairie dogs.

Above ground, prairie dog colonies literally
change the land. Mounds created from the excavation
of burrows may be two feet high and ten feet in diame-
ter. These serve as lookout posts and will keep the bur-
rows dry from rain. Prairie dogs’ communication
system is sophisticated. Biologists have identified
twelve different vocalizations and a variety of postures
and behavioral displays. One researcher studying a
Utah prairie dog population near Bryce Canyon
National Park noted specific calls, distinguishing
between the calls made when a truck versus a coyote
crossed into their territory. When danger is near, a
series of barks occurs in a prairie dog chorus, often led
by sentinel dogs guarding the periphery of the colony.
The word spreads. They quickly scramble and scurry
across the desert and disappear into nearby holes. When
danger seems to have passed, a prairie dog will care-
fully emerge, look in all directions, then stand on its
mound and throw back its head, with its hands raised in
what looks like a gesture of prayer, and give what has
been called a jump-yip call that the coast is clear.

It is also common to see prairie dogs engage in
what looks like kissing. The “kiss” is used to distin-
guish one coterie member from another. When prairie
dogs recognize each other, they will participate in elab-
orate grooming behavior. If one of the prairie dogs is an
intruder, teeth may be bared, territory fought over,
claimed, or reclaimed by dominant males. In most cases
the outsider flees.

Below ground, a burrow will typically be three to
six feet deep and about fifteen feet long, although the
size varies tremendously, depending on the landscape.
Prairie dogs will often dig small chambers to the side of
the main burrow where they can listen to what is going
on above. Deeper inside the burrows, they make nests
out of grasses they have pulled under, where they will
sleep, give birth, and care for their young (four is the
norm) in spring, with the babies usually not emerging
until June. Native grasses make up 70 to 95 percent of
their diet during the summer, changing to seeds and
insects, even roots, as fall and winter approach.

32,

Prairie dogs create habitat not only for themselves
but also for other grassland species. With their mounds
and extensive burrowing systems (black-tailed prairie
dogs typically have thirty to fifty burrow entrances per
acre, while Gunnison’s and white-tailed prairie dogs
have fewer than twenty), their underground world is not
simply the haunt of prairie dogs but home to myriad
other creatures as well. One study of black-tailed
prairie dogs identified more than 140 species of
wildlife associated with prairie dog towns. In a grass-
land community historically tamped down by the
weight of stampeding bison, burrowing prairie dogs
loosen and aerate the soil, keeping the land supple. In
the spring and summer, they also spend most of their
time foraging above ground. A single prairie dog may
consume two pounds of green grasses and forbs per
week. Their hunger alters the landscape.

Prairie dogs’ digging and scratching stimulates the
soil, creating greater opportunities for seeds to germi-
nate. With heightened water drainage due to the tun-
nels, plants grow. Plant diversity follows. Animal
diversity follows the plants. Meadowlarks appear with
an appetite for grasshoppers. Grasshopper sparrows
appear in the abundance of seeds. Vacant or abandoned
prairie dog burrows become the homes of cottontails,
kangaroo rats, and deer mice. Burrowing owls, with
their long, spindly legs, stand on the former mounds of
prairie dogs with an eye for the multiplying mice. One
successful life inspires another, creating the strength of
a grassland community. If the prairie dog goes, so goes
an entire ecosystem, including the black-footed ferret
and burrowing owl, which now are endangered and
threatened species. Prairie dogs create diversity.

The main function of the second paragraph (lines

11-12) is to:

A. present a common assumption about prairie dogs
that will be refuted in the next three paragraphs
(lines 13-53).
describe several aspects of the “double life” of
prairie dogs.

C. introduce the information that follows in the next
three paragraphs (lines 13-53).

D. outline the two controversial perspectives that will
be debated in the rest of the passage.

Which of the following quotations best captures the
third paragraph’s (lines 13~33) main focus?

FE. “These serve as lookout posts” (line 16).

“Prairie dogs’ communication system is sophisti-
cated” (lines 17-18).

“When danger is near, a series of barks occurs ina

Plants from Species X can be tall or short, and they
can have red, pink, or white flowers. Height in Species X
plants is controlled by Gene T, which has 2 alleles, T and t.
Flower color in Species X plants is controlled by Gene R,
which also has 2 alleles, R and r. To determine how height
and flower color are inherited in Species X, a student con-
ducted the following crosses.

Cross 1

Two tall Species X plants, each with the genotype Tr,
were crossed. The numbers and phenotypes of the resulting
offspring are shown in Table 1.

In each trial, the beam being tested was supported at
2 points that were 0.10 m apart and equidistant from the
midpoint of the beam. The beam was subjected to a load,
W, measured in newtons (N), at the midpoint of the beam.
W was provided by weights placed on the platform of the
apparatus. During deformation, each beam became slightly
U-shaped (see Figure 3).

A dial on the apparatus registered the distance, D, the beam
was deformed in multiples of 10° m. After D was mea-
sured, the load was removed, and the beam returned to its
original shape.

The intrinsic stiffness of the metal composing a beam
was represented by Young’s modulus, E. The effect of the
width and height of a beam (see Figure 1) on D was
represented by the quantity /, given in m‘.

Passage IV

When an oil is exposed to air, small amounts of reac-
tive peroxides can form in the oil. If the peroxide concen-
tration reaches a certain level, the oil will rapidly
decompose to form acidic organic compounds such as
formic acid. Scientists use an accelerated oxidation appa-
ratus, AOA, to model this process on a short time scale
(see diagram).

diagram of AOA

A 3 g oil sample is heated to a certain temperature. Starting
at time = 0 min, dry air is bubbled through the sample at a
constant rate. The flow of air carries organic acids pro-
duced in the sample into the flask containing water. The
conductivity (ease of electric flow) of the water is moni-
tored. The conductivity of the water stays relativély con-
stant until the oil rapidly decomposes. As the oil rapidly
decomposes, the conductivity sharply increases. The length
of time from 0 min until this increase occurs is the
induction period.

Biodiesels are renewable fuel oils typically made from
soybeans. Scientists did 3 experiments to study 4 bio-
diesels (BD1-BD4). BD2 was a 50/50 mixture of BD1 and
BD4 by volume.

Experiment I

The induction period was determined for fresh sam~-
ples of BD1-BD4 at 4 temperatures (see Figure 1).

Passage V

In wetlands, the herbicides atrazine and alachlor are
removed from the water by plant uptake or by adsorption
onto soil particles and subsequent bacterial decomposition.
Atrazine can also spontaneously break down to form
deethylatrazine (DEA).

Three pairs of herbicide-free wetlands were estab-
lished for a study: open water (O1, 02), submergent (S1,
$2), and emergent (El, E2), as described in Table 1. On
1 day, atrazine was added to Ol, S1, and El and alachlor
was added to 02, $2, and E2 to produce an initial herbicide
concentration of 25 g/L in the water in each wetland.
Atrazine, alachlor, and DEA concentrations in the water
were measured at intervals over the next 120 days (see
Figures 1-3).

Table 1

According to Figures | and 3, in S1, as the atrazine
concentration decreased, the DEA concentration:

H. increased, then decreased.
J. decreased, then increased.

Is the statement “Over the 120 days of the study,

atrazine concentration was most reduced in the water

in the open water wetland” supported by the data in

Figure 1?

A. Yes; 120 days after atrazine was added, its concen-
tration was least in the water in O1.

B. Yes; 120 days after atrazine was added, its concen-
tration was least in the water in El.

C. No; 120 days after atrazine was added, its concen-
tration was least in the water in O1.

D. No; 120 days after atrazine was added, its concen-
tration was least in the water in E1.

ACT-680

28. As shown in Figure 2, every time the alachlor concen-

trations in the water in 02, $2, and E2 were measured
during the study, the concentrations in $2 and E2 were
found to be very similar to the concentration in O2.

The most likely explanation for this result is that in S2
and E2:

F. plant uptake played a more significant role in
removing alachlor than did adsorption onto soil
particles followed by bacterial decomposition.

G. plant uptake played a less significant role in
removing alachlor than did adsorption onto soil
particles followed by bacterial decomposition.

H. adsorption onto soil particles followed by bacterial
decomposition played a more significant role in
removing alachlor than did breakdown to form
DEA.

J. adsorption onto soil particles followed by bacterial
decomposition played a less significant role in
removing alachlor than did breakdown to form
DEA.

Passage VI

A science teacher tells students that a ball on a string
is in motion, and that the speed of the ball, v, is measured
twice in rapid succession and is found to be increasing.
The teacher then asks each of 3 students to describe the
ball’s motion between and after the 2 measurements of v.

While analyzing the students’ statements, consider the
following information about the ball:

* The amount of angular momentum of the ball, AM,
equals mvr, where m is the ball’s mass and r is the dis-
tance of the ball from a reference point.

* The ball’s kinetic energy, KE, equals Fim?

* The ball’s total mechanical energy, TME, equals
KE + PE, where PE is potential energy that is available
to be converted into the ball’s KE. If 7ME remains the
same during the ball’s motion, then TME is said to be
conserved.

Student 1

The ball and string are suspended from a ceiling,
forming a pendulum, and the pendulum is swinging with-
out friction (see Figure 1).

ceiling

we

°
£L
ball

Figure 1

The speed v increases between the 2 measurements
because the ball is approaching the lowest point in its path,
Point L. At Point L, v has its greatest value; as the ball
moves past Point L, v begins to decrease immediately. The
decrease in v continues until the ball reaches one of the
2 end points of its path, Point A or Point B. Once the ball
reaches an end point, it reverses its direction of motion,
and v again begins to increase.

ACT-S8C

46

Student 2

One end of the string is threaded through a hole in a
horizontal tabletop. While a student pulls down on the
string, steadily decreasing r, the ball continuously slides
without friction around the hole (see Figure 2).

top view

tabletop

side view
Figure 2

The speed v increases between the 2 measurements
because the product vr remains constant; v will continue to
increase as r decreases.

Student 3

The ball is on a horizontal tabletop that is against a
wall. The string, which is fastened to the wall, is elastic
and has been stretched. The ball slides without friction
toward the wall (see Figure 3).

<—wall

tabletop

Figure 3

Between the 2 measurements, the string is contracting,
so v increases. Once the string is no longer stretched, v
Temains constant until the ball hits the wall. After the ball
bounces off the wall, v remains constant until the string
begins to stretch again, at which time v begins to decrease.

Based on Student 1’s description of the ball’s motion,
compared to the ball’s KE at Point A or Point B, the
ball’s KE at Point L is:

A. greater, because v is greater at Point L.
B. greater, because v is less at Point L.
C. less, because v is greater at Point L.
D. less, because v is less at Point L.

moving away from the wall and is slowing down, PE is
accumulating. Where is the accumulating PE being
stored?

J. In the string

Throughout the ball’s motion as described. by Stu-
dent 1, does the amount of angular momentum of the
ball, AM, remain constant?

A. Yes, because although v does not remain constant,

m and 7 do remain constant.

Yes, because although r does not remain constant,

m and v do remain constant.

C. No, because although m and v remain constant,
r does not remain constant.

D. No, because although m and r remain constant,
v does not remain constant.

Based on Student 2’s description of the motion of the
ball, as r decreases, how does the ball’s KE change?

FE. It increases, because v increases.
G. It increases, because v decreases.

vided, m, in atm, of this solution at 290 K can be calcu-
lated using which of the following expressions?

A. 0.0821 x 290x1*1
B. 0.0821 x 290 x 1 x2
C. 0.0821 x 290 x2 x2
D. 0.0821 290 x3 x2

Suppose a new line showing how 1 varies for aqueous
MgCl, solutions at 340 K were added to Figure 1. How
would this new line compare to the lines shown in
Figure 1 for aqueous NaCl solutions and aqueous glu-
cose solutions at 340 K ?

F. The y-intercept would remain the same, but the
slope of the line would be greater.

G. The y-intercept would remain the same, but the
slope of the line would be smaller.

H. The y-intercept would be greater, but the slope of
the line would remain the same.

J. The y-intercept would be smaller, but the slope of
the line would remain the same.
