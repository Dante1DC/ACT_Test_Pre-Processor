This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On
the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered
to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are
lettered to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the
oval in that row lettered the same as your answer.
Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil
and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink
or a mechanical pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark
thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each
question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals
with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only
on the number of questions you answer correctly during
the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized
for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing
staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is
called for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a test on which time has
already been called, and you may not go ahead to
another test. To do so will disqualify you from the
examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called
at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill
in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

PASSAGE |
King Tut’s Space Bug
Among the treasures found in Pharaoh
Tutankhamen’s tomb, in the 1920s one diminutive

T
ornament poses a mystery that spans the ages. The

“pectoral,” a kind of jewelry worn on one’s chest depicts

Egyptian symbols with gold and gems. Most strikingly,
at the piece’s center is a beetle carved from an ethereal
yellow-green material.

[1] Originally, archaeologists identified the beetle
as chalcedony, a quartz gemstone. [2] In 1996, likewise,
mineralogist Vincenzo de Michele noticed the beetle at
the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and suspected it wasn’t
chalcedony. [3] After studying the beetle, he determined
it to be 28.5-million-year-old glass. [4] De Michele
then traced the glass to the Great Sand Sea of
western Egypt, where pieces of it lay strewn
across 6,500 square kilometers. [5] Glass is

made by heating substances, such as, sand.

expecting her to share in my horror.

This time, the tentacles unfolded from the windows
of a large yellow house. I covered my eyes, and Rhonda

said, “Louise. It’s just an art installation.” I peered

through my fingers as she told me that Andrew Anderson,

a local artist | 25 |, had created the pink kraken. I had to

admit that the kraken looked kind of friendly up close.

ENIAC was designed during World War II with the

trajectory tables that would of allowed artillery to be

adjusted quickly.

A group of men designed and built ENIAC, a group
33
of six women mathematicians, lead by Jean Jennings

Ey
Bartik, programmed it. Bartik and her team figured out

how to set ENIAC’s 3,000 switches and hundreds of
connection cables so that it could run each calculation
correctly. Programming ENIAC required enormous
patience. To change a program, the women had to rewire
the machine manually by manipulating punch cards and
switches in a series of wiring boards. It could take as
long as two days to make even a small change.

Once Bartik’s team finished a program, though,
35

a complex calculation such that it would have taken
36
a human several days to complete could be done by

ENIAC in a fraction of a second. Therefore, the machine

PASSAGE IV
Painting Outside the Lines
O]
Today, Yankton Sioux modernist painter, Oscar Howe,
%

is recognized as one of the most influential American

Indian artists of the twentieth century. Howe received

many prizes and accolades during his career. | 47] But a

pivotal moment in 1958 led to his emergence as a key

position responsible for broadening the boundaries of
American Indian art.
[2]
In 1958, Howe submitted a painting, Umine Wacipe:

War and Peace Dance, to the Philbrook Art Center for
consideration in the museum’s annual competition
showcasing art by American Indians. Representative
of Howe’s style at the time, the painting featured sharp,
angular shapes in rich pink, blue, and purple hues that
geometrically depicted five dancers. [A] The jurors for the
competition rejected Howe’s submission, claiming it was
“a fine painting . . . but not Indian.” The then widely held

cy

jurors shared the position that American Indian art

should be based on the conventions of the Studio style.

World War II, Howe met the woman who
would later become his wife, Heidi Hampel.

Should the writer make this addition here?

A. Yes, because it establishes Hampel as an important
figure in Howe’s life and work.

B. Yes, because it offers details about Howe’s life
that are later expanded upon in the essay.

C. No, because it provides a detail about Howe’s life

Works in this style depict traditional ceremonies, dance,
and mythology and feature strong outlines and flat fields

of color. [B] Howe’s deviation from the style, in particular

his use of certain techniques, was perceived to be the

Bt

result of European influences, which the jurors considered
By
incompatible with authentic American Indian art.

[3]
Howe displayed his work in more than sixty solo
33

art shows. In an open letter, Howe argued that adhering
By

and sticking to notions of tradition would suffocate
Ey
innovation in American Indian art. Furthermore, he argued,

his work did employ American Indian art conventions. The
angular shapes in his painting, Howe noted, is actually

5
derivative of the Dakota notion of tohokmu, the spider web.

[4]
The Philbrook’s jurors conceded; they expanded the
scope of the competition to internalize experimental art.

[C] Although questions related to art and identity are still

on people’s minds, Howe’s efforts continue to inspire

[3] Still, qualifying for the IWC requires rigorous

performer’s ability to carry a tune. [5] Presentation

Participants can compete in both classical and popular
musical categories. They might, nevertheless, whistle an
entire movement from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or a
more modern selection from pop artist Beyoncé. Many
returning participants ambitiously aim on top of their
previous performances with even more complex pieces.

Competitors, however, are far from cutthroat. The
global whistling community is a tight-knit family, and
Louisburg its home. A 2012 documentary about the IWC
captures these sentiments. Filmmaker, Ien Chi, a first-time
whistling competitor himself, tells the story of a niche
group of individuals from Japan, Korea, France, Israel,

and elsewhere, whose mutual passion for whistling

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
memoir City Kid by Nelson George (©2009 by Nelson George).

Tam in the living room of apartment 6C in the
Samuel J. Tilden housing projects in Brownsville,
Brooklyn. It is 1960. Iam four. I stand on my tiptoes in
my stocking feet. My small brown fingers clutch the
edge of a Motorola high-fidelity stereo, which is made
of shiny lacquered wood and has a lemony smell, from
the polish my mother applies every Saturday afternoon.

I feel the bass speakers in my stomach. I smell the
polish. I feel the music. Looking over the edge, down
into the bowels of the hi-fi, I watch the turntable needle
roll across the grooves of a seven-inch record with a
blue-and-white label at 45 revolutions per minute. The
song is “Please Mr. Postman” by the Marvelettes.

As much as I enjoy “Please Mr. Postman,” I’m
anxious to hear the next record. Not just because it’s
Roy Orbison’s “Oh, Pretty Woman” (which is the first
record I ever asked my mother to buy for me), but
because above “Mr. Postman” on the turntable are a
slew of seven-inch singles suspended around a fat
brown cylinder. Once “Please Mr. Postman” finishes,
the needle arm moves away, a single vinyl 45 plops
down on the turntable, and the needle returns, catching
the groove and sending the rhythm of “Oh, Pretty
Woman” vibrating through my body.

This Motorola stereo was the centerpiece of my
family’s living room, and our social life. Ma didn’t
allow my little sister, Andrea, or me in our living room
too often, because she didn’t want us sitting on her
plastic-covered sofa or fingering the dice-shaped lighter
on her glass-and-wood living-room table. But if we
were playing records in the early evenings or on week-
ends, it was okay.

All through my childhood, from my first con-
sciousness of music into the early seventies, that
Motorola was my passport, not simply to records, but to
the vast nation outside New York that the music came
from. While the black-and-red labels of Atlantic 45s
carried a Broadway address, most of the records in her
collection came from Memphis (the Stax Records label
was pale blue, with a finger-snapping logo) or Detroit

(Motown’s black-and-white label had a red star for the
Motor City, while Tamla’s colors were yellow and
brown). As I read the labels of the records Ma brought
home, I slowly became familiar with the cities of
soul—Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Cincin-
nati. By the time I was an adolescent, I could identify
certain names that recurred in the credits. Way before I
understood what these credits meant, or who these
people were, I was already collecting info for the books
and articles I had no idea I would eventually write.

My interest in these records stemmed from a
desire to better understand my mother’s life. My mother
was a soul girl: petite and cute, with a bright, girlish
smile. Arizona Bacchus George, aka Doll, aka Ma, was
full of life, and loved to laugh. Though burdened with
raising two kids alone in a Brooklyn housing project,
she didn’t allow herself to become a stranger to fun.
Not only was her ever-growing stack of 45s a testament
to her love of music and dance, but she regularly held
parties in that sacrosanct living room for her girlfriends
and their male admirers.

I remember the time we took a pilgrimage to the
Apollo Theater for a matinee show. It was a chilly,
overcast day, and my mother and I joined a long line of
black folk, as far as I could see, huddled on 125th
Street, awaiting entry. Once inside, we sat in the
orchestra near the back. I remember the elements of the
James Brown Revue quite distinctly: Pigmeat Markham
did his famous “Here Comes the Judge” routine; the
Fabulous Flames danced like demons and harmonized
like choir boys; the J.B.s, behind the antic introduction
of MC Danny Ray, banged out a medley of the great
man’s hits.

Then Brown himself appeared, a short, dark man
with shiny, processed hair who whirled and shuddered
and shouted. On the way back to Brooklyn on the A
train, I babbled to my mother about the sweaty man
who kept tossing the cape off his back and running back
to the mike to wail, “Please! Please! Please!”

It was special for me, not only because I’d seen
James Brown, but because I was too young for so many
of the shows my mother attended. Unlike today, when
the separation between adult and kid entertainment has
been blurred to the detriment of both, soul music was
fundamentally music by, about, and for adults. When

my ma put on her auburn wig to see Otis Redding, or
her blue eyeliner to watch the Supremes, it was to expe-
rience things so raw and so smooth, they weren’t right
for a child to see.

The tone of the passage could best be described as:

A. remorseful; the narrator imagines the life his
mother could have had without the burden of rais-
ing a family in a Brooklyn housing project.

B. jubilant; the narrator expresses his delight that the
musicians he revered in childhood eventually
became such big stars.

C. inspirational; the narrator explains how he man-
aged to overcome the obstacles he faced during
childhood and pursue an education in music.

D. nostalgic; the narrator fondly describes his child-

hood experiences with music and his relationship
with his mother.

In the fourth paragraph (lines 25-32), the perspective
of the narrator shifts from being that of a child describ-
ing an enjoyable experience to being that of:

F. an adult reflecting on the role music played during
his childhood.

G. an adult reminiscing about his relationship with
his sister.

H. a child daydreaming about what his life will be
like when he grows up.

J. achild describing what his mother likes to do for

fun.

The passage states that as a child the narrator associ-
ated the colors and designs on the labels of his
mother’s records with:

A. favorite musicians.
B. various genres of music.
C. different American cities.

D. important events that occurred in his childhood.

. It can reasonably be inferred that the phrase “the great

man’s hits” (lines 72-73) refers to the music of:

F. James Brown.

G. Otis Redding.

H. MC Danny Ray.

J. Pigmeat Markham.

. In the narrator’s description of his mother’s stereo,

which detail most clearly points to the care she gave it?

A. “Motorola high-fidelity” (line 5)
B. “Lacquered wood” (line 6)

C. “Lemony smell” (line 6)

D. “Fat brown cylinder” (lines 19-20)

. The passage indicates that the first record the narrator

asked his mother to buy for him was by:

F._ the Marvelettes.
G. Roy Orbison.
H. Otis Redding.
J. James Brown.

. The passage suggests that the narrator was initially

drawn to his mother’s records because he wanted to:

A. learn about places outside of New York City.

B. sing and dance in the style of the great soul
musicians.

C. impress his friends with his knowledge of soul
music.

D. gain insight into his mother’s life.

. The narrator describes the performances of which of

the following Apollo Theater performers in terms of
the contrast between singing style and dancing style?

F. Pigmeat Markham
G. MC Danny Ray

H. The J.B.s

J. The Fabulous Flames

. The narrator suggests that going to the concert at the

Apollo Theater was special because:

A. Otis Redding and the Supremes joined James
Brown onstage.

B. soul music wasn’t considered appropriate for
children.

C. James Brown was his favorite musician.

D._ it was the first time he had ridden a train.

Another writer made the following statement about
soul music:

Musically, I believe, soul remains the story of
how a universal sound emerged from the black
church.

How does this statement relate to the ideas expressed

in the passage?

F. It echoes the narrator’s view of soul as he recalls
the living room, where he listened to music.

G. It’s consistent with the narrator’s opinion that soul
was originally meant to be music for listeners of
all races.

H. It contradicts the narrator’s claim that soul was
secular music, not religious music.

J. It addresses a topic, the origin of soul, which the

narrator doesn’t address in the passage.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: Passage A is adapted from the article
“Talk to the Hands” by Jen Doll (©2013 by The Atlantic Monthly
Group). Passage B is adapted from the article “Gestures Offer
Insight” by Ipke Wachsmuth (©2006 by Scientific American).

Passage A by Jen Doll

Leaving a group of friends the other night, I turned
to wave. “Text me!” one of them said, waggling her
thumbs in the air. I didn’t need the words to understand.

Today, we may be more likely to move our fingers
across a tablet than turn the pages of a book; to swipe a
card, press a button, or enter numbers onto a keypad
than turn a key. We type on keyboards more often than
we put pens to paper, and we roll down the windows of
our cars by pressing a button instead of cranking a
handle. Yet when it comes to gesturing, certain out-
dated motions endure.

Gestures can generally be sorted into two cate-
gories, according to Spencer Kelly, an associate profes-
sor of psychology at Colgate University. “Co-speech
gestures” are the idiosyncratic, often unconscious ways
we move our hands as we talk. Researchers believe
these gestures help us think and speak and even learn.
“Emblematic gestures” are the culturally codified
motions that we use to supplement or substitute
speech—the peace sign, the thumbs-up. Some of these
gestures are symbolic, and some, as in the case of
thumb-texting, are imitative.

As with words, we tend to pick up our hand move-
ments from the groups with whom we communicate
most frequently—especially our peers. If your friends
are thumb-texting at you, you will thumb-text back at
them. Soon enough, Kelly says, “the movement of your
thumbs can be done without speech, and people know
what it is. That’s the definition of an emblem.”

Some emblems are recycled, their meanings
changing as cultures evolve. Anthony Corbeill at the
University of Kansas suspects that the current Ameri-
can connotation of the thumbs-up gesture developed
during the 20th century, when GIs used the thumbs-up
to signify that a plane was cleared for takeoff. Other
emblems are coined afresh, the result of ubiquitous new
technology or the quirks of a public figure. The fist
bump, which went viral after Barack and Michelle
Obama were photographed in action in 2008, can be
traced to the germophobic mid-20th-century baseball
player Stan Musial, who is said to have preferred it to
the high five.

Passage B by Ipke Wachsmuth

The interpretations of sounds and movements are
closely related. For years, the link could be demon-
strated only indirectly by asking test subjects what
information they gleaned from others who were speak-
ing and gesticulating. Recent brain research has pro-
vided much better insight. For example, neuroscientist

Spencer D. Kelly of Colgate University has studied ges-
tures with the help of event-related potentials—charac-
teristic brain waves consisting of a sequence of peaks
and valleys—that occur in certain patterns when one
person observes another communicating. The patterns
reveal neuronal-processing steps in particular brain
regions. One of the negative peaks (a valley), referred
to as N400, is especially significant. It occurs when we
stumble over an inappropriate and unexpected word, for
example, when we hear a sentence like “He spread his
toast with socks.”

Kelly hooked test subjects to an electroencephalo-
graph and charted their event-related potentials while
they watched a video. In it, an actor spoke while using
gestures to indicate characteristics of an object. A hand
movement might fit a word semantically, such as when
the word “tall” was illustrated by gesturing at a long-
stem glass on a table. A gesture might also be used to
convey additional information, such as when “tall” was
accompanied by finger movements that indicated the
thinness of the elongated stem of the glass. Viewers
saw contradictory scenes, too, in which an actor com-
bined the word “tall” with a gesture that referred to a
short object on the table. And sometimes an actor made
no gesture at all; in this control situation, the test sub-
jects heard only the spoken word.

Subjects exhibited substantially different brain-
wave patterns depending on the situation. The
researchers found strong negative peaks—a so-called
N400 effect—whenever speech and gesture contra-
dicted one another. They interpreted this phenomenon
to mean that gestures and words are in fact processed
together: observers factor the meaning of a gesture into
their interpretation of a word.

This conclusion was supported by the finding that
the event-related potentials exhibited no comparable
negativity in the control situation. Even during early
processing, the curves differ depending on whether the
hand movement fits the word, complements it or contra-
dicts it. “The semantic content” of hand gestures, Kelly
says, “contributes to the processing of word meaning in
the brain.”

The main point of the second paragraph of Passage A
(lines 4-11) is that:

F. although technology is changing how we interact
with the world, many gestures remain the same.

G. we have more ways to communicate than ever, so
gestures are increasingly important.

H. as a result of new technologies, new gestures are
being created at a fast rate.

J. because technology has become so complicated,
gestures are symbolic of simpler times.

wave patterns depending on the situation”
(lines 75-76).

C. “Observers factor the meaning of a gesture into
their interpretation of a word” (lines 81-82).

“The curves differ depending on whether the hand
movement fits the word, complements it or contra-
dicts it” (lines 86-88).

Details in Passage B most strongly suggest that recent
research into the relationship between speech and ges-
tures is more fruitful than previous research because
scientists can now:

F. simultaneously test reactions to both logical and
illogical speech and gestures.

G. objectively measure the brain’s responses to
speech and gestures.

H. question test subjects about their reactions to
gestures.

J. use video recording to document how gestures
change over time.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the book The
Lost Painting by Jonathan Harr (©2005 by Jonathan Harr).

The St. John is a painting by seventeenth-century Italian
painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. At the time of the
examinations, the Doria St. John version belonged to the Doria
Pamphili Gallery in Rome, and the Capitoline St. John version
belonged to the Capitoline Museum in Rome.

Close up, Francesca Cappelletti could see the
damage caused to the Doria St. John by time. Over its
entire surface the picture had lost many tiny particles of
paint, mere pinpricks—puntinature, Paola Sannucci, the
restorer, called them—not discernible from a normal
viewing distance. These particles had fallen at nearly
regular intervals, at the intersections where the threads
of the canvas, the warp and the weft, crossed each other
and formed small nodules. The canvas had been cheap,
made of poor-quality hemp and carelessly woven. Still,
Caravaggio might have used just such a canvas. He had
once painted a picture on a bedsheet. Another time,
after he’d left the Mattei palazzo and was living alone
in a small house off the Via della Scrofa, he had spread
a half-finished canvas on a kitchen table and dined off
the back of it.

The earlier examination of the Capitoline St. John
had revealed it to be in much better shape than the
Doria, in large part because the Capitoline canvas was
of higher quality, more tightly woven with linen threads
of uniform diameter.

The technical examination lasted the entire day,
and for long periods Francesca had nothing to do but
observe. The portable X-ray machine could capture
only a small portion of the painting, and the technicians
had to keep repositioning the machine, sixteen times in
all, to get a composite of the entire picture. Francesca
wandered in and out of the room and tried to dream up
an excuse for leaving early.

Giampaolo Correale had a particular interest—an
obsession, one could call it—with finding incised lines
in Caravaggio’s paintings. Few other Baroque painters
had made these types of lines, scored with the butt end
of a brush into the wet undercoat, and no one had made
them in quite the same way as Caravaggio. He painted
from life, from models sitting before him, and most art
historians believed that he didn’t make preliminary
drawings. In this, he had departed from a long-
established tradition by which painters made detailed
studies before applying brush to canvas. The scored
lines, it was surmised, had served as a guide for posi-
tioning his models. In the finished paintings, the lines
were sometimes visible to the naked eye, usually at a
certain angle, in a raking light. Not every one of his
paintings revealed signs of these marks. But to
Caravaggio experts, their presence was almost as good
as the artist’s signature.

Two weeks earlier, during the examination of the
Capitoline St. John, Correale had hoped to find incised

lines, and thus add to the proof that it was Caravaggio’s
original. He and Paola Sannucci and the technicians had
scrutinized every inch of the painting, but in the end
they had not found a scoring mark. True, there were a
few faint ridges on the borders of the boy’s figure, and
for a while Correale maintained that these could be
scoring marks, but everyone else interpreted them
merely as brushstrokes in wet paint, places where
Caravaggio had defined the boy’s flesh against the dark
background.

But evidence of a different kind had emerged from
beneath the surface of the Capitoline version, and it
seemed to confirm the painting’s authenticity. The
X rays and the infrared images had revealed a ghostly
image—a pentimento—at the precise point where the
boy’s arm and the curved horn of the ram intersected.
The artist had painted the arm first, and then had
painted the ram’s horn over the finished arm. This con-
stituted a clear sign that the painting was the authentic
one. A copyist, following the outlines of an original
painting, would not have bothered to paint the arm and
then paint the horn over it. The infrared images also
revealed other pentimenti, in the folds and drapery of
the red and white cloths, and in the foliage in the dark
background. These were false starts and adjustments
that no copyist would have needed to make.

So Correale had come to accept the Capitoline as
the original even before the technical examination of
the Doria version. All the same, the paintings were so
strikingly similar—the outline of one placed atop the
other matched in almost every contour—that it seemed
necessary to examine the Doria picture as fully as the
Capitoline. But how, Correale wondered, could anyone
make such a near perfect copy?

This question interested Francesca, too. She
thought of all the copies art historian Roberto Longhi
had found of Caravaggio’s lost Taking of Christ. None
of them had been good enough for Longhi to mistake
for the original. Yet the Doria St. John had fooled him
completely.

Which of the following statements comparing the
Doria St. John and the Capitoline St. John is best sup-
ported by the passage?

A. The Doria St. John was painted on cheaper canvas
than was the Capitoline St. John.

B. The Doria St. John canvas had smaller nodules
than that of the Capitoline Sz. John.

C. The Capitoline St. John showed evidence of more
puntinature than did the Doria St. John.

D. The Capitoline St. John contained more incised
lines than did the Doria St. John.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that Francesca wanted to leave the examination early
mainly because she:

F. had already witnessed an examination of the Doria
St. John.

G. disliked working alongside Correale.

H. was uninterested in Caravaggio’s paintings.

J. disliked being a mere observer.

G. provide a more specific description of the scene
depicted in the St. John painting.

H. describe the steps a copyist must take when
re-creating a painting.

J. provide a definition of the term “pentimento.”

In the last paragraph, the comparison between
Longhi’s appraisal of the Taking of Christ copies and
Longhi’s appraisal of the Doria St. John mainly serves
to:

A. demonstrate that Taking of Christ was one of
Caravaggio’s more popular paintings.

B. suggest that Longhi studied the Taking of Christ
copies more thoroughly than he did the Doria
St. John.

C. emphasize that the Doria St. John was painted with
unusual skill.

Which of the following details from the passage best
exemplifies the idea that Caravaggio sometimes used
unconventional canvases for his paintings?

F. He once dined off the back of a half-finished

H. He painted the St. John on woven linen.

J. He once painted a picture on a bedsheet.

As it is used in line 24, the word capture most nearly

According to the passage, Caravaggio used incised
lines in his paintings most likely to:

F. guide the positioning of his models.

G. reflect light off the surface of his paintings.

H. indicate the authenticity of the painting.

J. separate his style from that of other Baroque
painters.

The passage states that most experts who study
Caravaggio agree that:

A. the practice of using incised lines in painting was
pioneered by Caravaggio.

B. the presence of Caravaggio’s style of incised lines
is strong evidence that a painting is an authentic
Caravaggio.

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the essay
“Archives of Life: Science and Collections” by Richard Fortey
(©2010 by Richard Fortey).

Safely stored behind the scenes at the Natural His-
tory Museum in London is a slightly twisted vertebrate
skeleton preserved on a slab of creamy white limestone.
This particular specimen was discovered in quarries
near Solnhofen in southern Germany in 1861. The fine
limestones of Solnhofen are ideally suited to making
lithographic stones, and in the nineteenth century litho-
graphs provided one of the most important means of
book illustration—indeed lithographic stones of this
quality are still in demand by artists today. Vast quanti-
ties of this lithographic limestone of Jurassic age—
about 150 million years old—have been taken out of
opencast workings, where the rocks can be split into
convenient slabs a centimetre or two thick. On many of
these flat-surfaced pieces of rock, fossils are laid out
like gifts on a salver.

Some Solnhofen fossils are rather common, such
as those of delicate little sea lilies. Others are both rare
and more spectacular. There are a great variety of fish
species known nowhere else, for example. The fossil
horseshoe crab Mesolimulus provides evidence that its
living relatives breeding each year along the Atlantic
coast of America have changed little over tens of mil-
lions of years. Delicate flying reptiles—half a dozen
species or so of pterodactyl—testify by contrast to crea-
tures that have vanished from the Earth forever. A few
species of dinosaur are known, of the most delicate sort
(Compsognathus), and quite unlike the monsters of
popular imagination. Insects include dragonflies
(Aeschnogomphus) whose every wing-vein is visible as
delicate tracery. All these creatures are preserved in
rocks which originated as tacky muds flooring a lagoon
that lay offshore from a richly biodiverse habitat. Such
special circumstances sampled and preserved a much
wider variety of organisms than the usual fossil locality,
and the wide range of fossils provides a rare window
into an entire habitat from a very different world. Yet if
the remains were not kept carefully in museums all this
evidence of past life would perish, and new generations
of children and scholars could not interrogate the past.
Local museums at Eichstatt and Solnhofen fulfil that
function for those who would come to Bavaria and
marvel at its geological treasures. But some of the spec-
imens from the Solnhofen limestone have a relevance
that extends far beyond the reconstruction of the late
Jurassic scene, and these specimens are treasures in the
collections of museums around the world. None more
so than that specimen—a mere 35 cm at its longest—
safely curated in the Natural History Museum in
London.

For this is the first example ever discovered of the
early bird Archaeopteryx. It remains one of the most
important specimens in the British national collections.
The next complete fossil bird of the same species—the
so-called Berlin specimen—was found sixteen years

later. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of
this London specimen of Archaeopteryx in the history
of biology.

First, the date of its discovery is only two years
after the publication of The Origin of Species. Charles
Darwin famously described what he called ‘difficulties
on theory’ in that work, where he anticipated a number
of criticisms that he expected his great idea to
encounter. Prime among these was ‘the rarity or
absence of intermediate forms’ in the fossil record.
Second, the detailed scientific description of
Archaeopteryx was an accomplishment of Richard
Owen in 1863; he was later to become first director of
the Natural History Museum. Owen was no Darwinian,
but he was an able anatomist. It must have proved
anathema to him when Archaeopteryx was recruited as
probably the best example of an ‘intermediate form’
and one that had turned up with the impeccable timing
usually associated with a good piece of theatre. Its
amalgam of reptilian and bird features (feathers and
wishbone among them) was a striking vindication of
the notion of descent with modification, and a rebuttal
to those who might wonder how it was possible for ani-
mals to make the transition from earth to the skies.

In this sense Archaeopteryx became a kind of talis-
man for evolution. Owen was enough of a ‘Museum
man’ to ensure that this fossil was safely curated, and
part of any museum’s function is just that—to protect
material regardless of the current explanations of its
importance. The old bird has now been joined by half a
dozen or so subsequent examples worldwide, but its
importance has not diminished over the years.

In terms of its overall structure, the passage can best be
described a:

A. a description of the types of specimens found at
the Natural History Museum in London, followed
by a discussion of the importance of the museum.

B. an overview of the geological discoveries made in
Solnhofen, followed by a discussion of one partic-
ular discovery.

C. a list of the types of fossils Darwin used to

particular fossil he discovered.

D. a general explanation of the process of making
lithographic stones, followed by an example of

The passage most strongly suggests that in the history
of biology, the discovery of the Archaeopteryx fossil
was significant mainly because it:

F. made the Natural History Museum of London the
most visited museum in the world.

G. was the first bird fossil ever discovered.

H. helped scientists accurately reconstruct the late
Jurassic scene.

J. helped fill a critical gap in Darwin’s evolutionary
theory.

The passage author’s characterization of Owen as a
“Museum man” (lines 81-82) can best be described as:

A. acompliment; the author respects Owen as both a
Darwinian and an anatomist.

B. a compliment; the author appreciates Owen’s
understanding of the importance of safely curating
a fossil.

C. an insult; the author resents Owen’s lack of inter-
est in the Archaeopteryx fossil.
an insult; the author believes the Archaeopteryx
fossil should have been curated by a more capable
anatomist than Owen.

In the passage, the main point the author makes about
museums is that they primarily:

F. exist to educate tourists about the areas they are
visiting.

G. function to protect and preserve specimens for
future study.

H. preserve only the specimens excavated from
nearby sites.

J. display only the specimens that are currently con-
sidered to be important.

The detail about the Archaeopteryx fossil being “a
mere 35 cm at its longest” (line 48) helps establish a
contrast between the fossil’s small size and the:

A. considerable time it took to curate the fossil.
B. substantial impact the fossil had on the scientific

community.

C. overall complexity of Archaeopteryx’s bone struc-
ture.

D. ferocity associated with the Archaeopteryx
species.

Which of the following events mentioned in the pas-
sage occurred first chronologically?

F. An Archaeopteryx fossil was discovered in
Solnhofen.

G. The Archaeopteryx fossil known as the Berlin
specimen was discovered.

H. Darwin’s book The Origin of Species

The passage author characterizes the timing of the
Archaeopteryx fossil discovery as ideal. Which of the
following people mentioned in the passage would be
most likely to support this characterization?

A. Darwin

B. Owen

C. Critics of Darwin’s theory

D. Visitors of the Eichstatt and Solnhofen museums

It can reasonably be inferred that one reason the
Archaeopteryx fossil qualifies as an example of an
“intermediate form” is that:

F. its mixture of reptilian and bird features demon-
strates the notion of descent with modification.

G. its significance was not fully realized until long
after it had been curated.

H. it was discovered in the time between the excava-
tions of the Mesolimulus and Compsognathus
fossils.

J. it convinced critics that animals were not yet capa-
ble of transitioning from earth to the skies.

sea lily fossils found at Solnhofen, the fossils of cer-
tain species of fish found at Solnhofen are more:

A. well-preserved.
B._ indistinct.

C. rare.

D. fragile.

Passage |

Two experiments examined how pH and temperature
affect the activity of Amoeba limax (a single-celled
eukaryote).

Experiment 1

Twenty identical glass slides were equally divided
into 5 groups (Groups 1-5). Each slide was then prepared
as follows: First, a drop of water containing a single 1-day-
old A. limax was placed on the slide. Next, the water (but
not the A. Jimax) was removed and replaced with a drop of
an aqueous solution having a pH of 8.2. Then, a glass cover
slip was placed over the drop, and paraffin (a type of wax)
was used to seal the edges of the cover slip.

Each of the Group | slides was incubated at a temper-
ature of 0°C. During incubation, the movement of the
A. limax on each slide was observed for 30 min, and
the total distance traveled (TDT) by the A. limax over the
30 min was recorded. The average TDT for Group | was
then determined.

The procedure for Group | was repeated for each of
Groups 2-5, except that each group was kept at a different
incubation temperature.

The results are shown in Table 1.

Experiment 2

Twenty more of the slides were equally divided into
5 groups (Groups 6-10). Each slide was prepared as in
Experiment 1, except that for each group, the aqueous solu-
tion had a different pH (see Table 2).

Each of the Group 6 slides was incubated at a temper-
ature of 10°C. During incubation, the movement of the
A. limax on each slide was observed for 30 min, and the
TDT by the A. limax over the 30 min was recorded. The
average TDT for Group 6 was then determined.

The procedure for Group 6 was repeated for each of
Groups 7-10.

The results are shown in Table 2.

Passage Il

The amino acid molecules necessary for life are
thought to have been produced on Earth before organisms
were present. Amino acids can be produced through chemi-
cal reactions among ammonia (NH;), methane (CH,),
hydrogen (H,), and water (H,O). Four hypotheses have
been proposed to describe the conditions that were respon-
sible for the production of amino acids on Earth.

Hypothesis 1
Amino acids were introduced to Earth by meteors
containing NH;, CH,, H,, and H,O. If the reactions among
these 4 substances are provided enough energy, amino
acids can be produced. As meteors containing these sub-
stances entered Earth’s atmosphere, the substances were
rapidly heated by friction, and this heat resulted in immedi-
ate amino acid production on the surface of the meteors.

Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis | is correct that meteors brought NH;,
CH,, H,, and H,O to Earth; however, amino acid produc-
tion did not occur on the meteors. Once a meteor contain-
ing these substances entered Earth’s atmosphere, the
substances were released into the atmosphere. Meteors
continued to enter the atmosphere over hundreds of mil-
lions of years. The concentration of these substances in the
atmosphere eventually became high enough for the reac-
tions that produce amino acids to occur. The energy pro-
vided to these reactions was UV light energy from the sun.

Hypothesis 3

Meteors had nothing to do with the production of
amino acids. Thermal vents (cracks in the floors of Earth’s
oceans) allowed magma from Earth’s crust to seep into the
ocean. The magma caused some of the ocean water to boil.
Since ocean water contains dissolved NH, CHy, and H,,
these substances were released into the atmosphere (along
with H,O) upon boiling. Then, UV light from the sun pro-
vided the energy for these substances to react to produce
amino acids.

Hypothesis 4

Magma from thermal vents did not provide enough
energy to cause ocean water to boil; however, the magma
did provide enough energy to cause the NH;, CHy, and H)
dissolved in ocean water to react with the ocean water, pro-

ducing amino acids. These reactions occurred near the ther-
mal vents.

ACT-FO7

8. Suppose that a scientist determined that UV light does
not provide enough energy to cause any chemical reac-
tions to occur. This finding would weaken which
hypotheses?

F. Hypotheses | and 2 only
G. Hypotheses | and 4 only
H. Hypotheses 2 and 3 only
J. Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 only

9. Hypothesis 3 and Hypothesis 4 agree on which of the
aspects of amino acid production listed below?

I. The source of the substances needed for
amino acid production
II. The location of amino acid production
Ill. The source of the energy needed for amino
acid production
A. Tonly
B. Ilonly
C. I and II only
D. I, II, and III

10. Which of Hypotheses | and 2, if either, state(s) or sug-
gest(s) that amino acid production occurred on the sur-
face of a meteor?

F. Hypothesis | only

G. Hypothesis 2 only

H. Both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2
J. Neither Hypothesis | nor Hypothesis 2

the 4 substances that form amino acids occurred in an
aqueous solution?

In each trial, the following occurred: First, the stu-
dents placed a platform with a ramp at a height Ay above a
sandbox. Then, they released either a 10 g solid sphere or a
10 g hollow sphere from a height h above the platform. The
sphere rolled down the ramp and through a photogate (a
device that emitted 2 beams of light, spaced 1.5 cm apart,
and calculated the speed, v, of a sphere passing through
both beams). Next, the students started a timer when the
sphere rolled off the platform, and they stopped the timer
when the sphere landed in the sandbox. They recorded this
time interval as the sphere’s time of flight, At. Last, they
measured the horizontal distance traveled by the sphere
while it was in flight, Ax.

Experiment 1

In Trials 1-5, the students set Ay to 95 cm and
released the solid sphere from various / (measured in cm).
They recorded v in centimeters per second (cm/sec), At in
sec, and Ax in cm (see Table 1).

Passage IV

The soil beneath a heavy structure can fail (crack or
flow). Adding wires to a soil produces a mixture with a
greater compressive strength than that of the soil alone.
(Compressive strength is the minimum downward pressure
that will cause a material to fail.)

Mixtures of Soil X and | mm diameter steel wires
were tested for compressive strength. All the wires in a
mixture had the same length (1 cm, 2 cm, or 3 cm) and the
same angle (90°, 120°, 150°, or 180°, as shown below).

Passage V

Ultraviolet (UV) light is harmful to skin. A sunscreen
applied to the skin lessens the skin’s exposure to the harm-
ful light, such as through absorption of the light. A sun-
screen’s sun protection factor (SPF) is a measure of its
ability to lessen exposure.

Students did 2 experiments to measure the absorbance
of UV light by various solutions at 25°C, each solution
containing a single sunscreen. To make their measure-

ments, the students used a spectrophotometer (see
diagram).

In each trial of the experiments, Steps 1-4 were
performed:

1. A solution having a particular sunscreen concentration
was prepared.

2. Four mL of the solution was poured into a clear plastic
vial, and the vial was placed in the spectrophotometer.

3. A beam of UV light was directed through the solution.

4. The absorbance was measured as the wavelength of the
UV light was varied from 290 nanometers (nm;
Inm= 10° m) through 400 nm. (Note: UVB light has
wavelengths from 290 nm to 320 nm; UVA light has
wavelengths from 320 nm to 400 nm.)

In the human body, O, and CO, are exchanged
between the lungs and the blood and between the blood and
the tissues as indicated in Figure 1. These exchanges occur
by the diffusion of each gas from a region where its partial

According to Figure 1, for a healthy resting person at
sea level, as blood passes through the left side of the
heart, which is greater, the Po, or the Peo, ?

The Po,; its value is 100 mm Hg through the left
side of the heart.

B. The Po,; its value is 40 mm Hg through the left
side of the heart.

C. The Peo,; its value is 100 mm Hg through the left
side of the heart.

D. The Poo,; its value is 46 mm Hg through the left

side of the heart.

The Peo, in the lung capillaries that enter the lung alve-
oli differs from the Peo, in the lung capillaries that
leave the lung alveoli. Based on Figure 1, for a healthy
resting person at sea level, what is the range of the Poo,
in the lung capillaries? -
F. From 0.3 mm Hg to 40 mm Hg

G. From 40 mm Hg to 46 mm Hg

H. From 46 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg
J. From 100 mm Hg to 152 mm Hg

Based on Figure 2, if a person’s alveolar ventilation
decreases from a value of 6.3 L/min, how do the
person’s alveolar Po, and alveolar Pco,, respectively,
change? 7 7

A. _ increase decrease
B increase increase
C. decrease increase
D. decrease decrease

Based on Figure 1, for a healthy resting person at sea
level, does O, in the air that enters the lung alveoli dif-
fuse into the lung capillaries?

F. Yes, because the P, in the lung alveoli is greater
than the Po, in the lung capillaries.

G. Yes, because the Po, in the lung capillaries is
greater than the Po, in the lung alveoli.

H. No, because the Po, in the lung alveoli is greater

than the Po, in the lung capillaries.
J. No, because the Po, in the lung capillaries is
greater than the Po, in the lung alveoli.

Consider the values of Po, and Peo, that are given in
Figure | for the lung alveoli. According to Figure 2, to
maintain those values, alveolar ventilation must be
closest to which of the following?

A. 2.1 L/min
B. 4.2 L/min
C. 6.3 L/min
D. 8.4 L/min

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely
