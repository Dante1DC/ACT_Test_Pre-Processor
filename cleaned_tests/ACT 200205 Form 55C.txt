ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the.passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

was a kind of exploration, a way to examine her life.

Tan also realized that, whether her work was
published or not, one could only learn about oneself by

writing in her own, Chinese-American, voice. That distinc-

tive voice is part of what made her first novel, The Joy
Luck Club, a best-seller.

Paragraph 6.

Home Improvement, or Not?
4)

Have you ever seen those home-improvement
shows on television? Beware, for they don’t tell the
whole story. These shows portray remodeling projects
under ideal conditions, not the conditions most of us
must contend with. I recently added a second bathroom
to my house, doing all the work myself. Over an entire
summer, I learned a lot about plumbing, electrical
wiring, and carpentry. I also learned about the four
stages of remodeling: Enthusiasm, Despair, ‘Adaptation, .
‘and Satisfaction.

(21
The first stage is marked by eagerness. One

morning you tear into a wall, feeling a trickle of
7

enthusiasm as plaster crumbles beneath your wrecking bar.

‘That enthusiasm sustains you for days as you take out the
old to build the new.
B)

But the wall your intent to cut an arch
through turns out to be brik, not wood. Lifting the
floorboards, you find a twisted mess of rusted pipe and
rotting wire. About then the building inspector stops
by, to ensure proper drainage, she says, you’ll have to

nr)
landscape the lawn.

Despair, however, soon gives up on

adaptation. Work on the project grows sporadic. You
pound a few nails, maybe patch over that hole in the
roof. You try to convince yourself things aren’t so” bad.
Ankle-deep in sawdust, you wonder: Do I really need
hot water?

: Eventually, you recall that you once had an

enjoyable life apart from power tools and plumbing.
You tackle the project once more, with enthusiasm—

Before too long in the future, you’re the proud owner

You sink into despair, the house you

his children to value time and-to spend it productively.
Even mealtimes were educational, devoted to discussions

evenings, too. Each night, Wyeth would tell stories of

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from a short story
titled “Lydia McQueen” by Wilma Dykeman, from her book The
Tall Woman (©1980 by Wilma Dykeman).

The wind was a wild dark thing plucking at the
trees outside, pushing at the door and chinks of the
house, then dying down still as death before another
rise and rush and plunge. Listening to it, Lydia
McQueen waited and shrank deeper under the quilts,
until the corn shucks in the mattress rustled and settled
into new shapes.

a

She thought about the wind—like the great fine

horse Papa had owned once, strong and willful with no

10 bit or stirrup that could tame it. Quiet for a spell, it

would break with a sudden burst of energy. Yet her

father, a gentle man, had controlled the wildness in the

horse as surely and invisibly as the sun controlled the
plants in her mother’s garden.

15 The wind came again and she felt the pleasure of
her own body-warmth. Like a seed, she felt, one of
those sun-warmed seeds in the spring ground, growing,
ready to give forth new life. She was aware of the dry
smell of the corn shucks. Her mind went: back to the
day she had sorted them, pulling the leaves off the hard
stalk ends, working toward a soft stuffing for the
mattress.

“It’s a fair morning,” she had said to her mother as
they worked out in the yard beside the corncrib, where
25 the shucks had been stored through the winter.

“Ah, fair enough today, but dogwood winter yet to
come,” her mother had answered.

And after the cold spell, when dogwoods bloomed,

there would be whippoorwill winter and blackberry

. 30 winter. The reminder cut through her joy. She set her

mouth and determined to be stingy with her words the

rest of the morning—until she spied the first flock of

robins down in the new-cleared field. Then she cried

out in pleasure again for her mother to come and see the

36 plump, neat birds, for Lydia Moore was eighteen, and
chancy too, like March.

But, “You’re a girl turned woman now,” her
mother said, “No need for such wispy ways. Anyway,

ACT-55C-SAMPLE 32

I’m of a mind they won’t last long around Mark
40 McQueen.”.

Lydia thrust a cornhusk into the sack so sharply
that one dry blade cut her middle finger. She knew her
mother had wanted her to marry Ham Nelson. “Ah,
Hamilton’s a well-turned boy, and the Nelsons are good
livers,” she had said when he brought Lydia home once
from a sociable at the Burkes’. And Lydia had replied,
remembering all that Ham had told her as they rode
home that night, “Could he buy himself for what he’s
worth, and sell himself for what he thinks he’s worth,
50 he’d be princely rich overnight.”

But Sarah Moore had not smiled. Neither had she
smiled when her daughter came to ask her if Mark
McQueen could speak to Jesse Moore about their
wedding. “With all the boys in the valley, Lydia, you

55 must choose him?”

“Mama, I didn’t choose.”

But she had felt helpless to explain how it was!
since that first day she’d seen Mark at the mill, big and
dark with the strength of a mountain in him. She was

60 full of a strange confidence and beauty, and wept to
herself behind the barn because she had so little
confidence and was so lacking in prettiness. It was a
time of days like spring, changeable and quick with
life. She had no words to fit such feelings. “I didn’t

65 choose, Mama. It’s like I was chosen.”

Her mother looked at her then, steadily.

“Living won’t be easy with Mark McQueen. He’s
a proud man, with a restlessness on him that will be
hard to still. Such a man’s life can hurt his wife, be he

70 ever so in love with her or not.”

3

For a moment she was quiet, looking no longer at
her daughter but at the distant woods. Lydia heard the
first spring insects humming out in the fields, heard
their tiny rustling in the dry cornhusks around her
where the warm sun was stirring them to life. But all
she saw in her mind’s eye was Mark McQueen’s face
and his stout sun-browned arms.

a

“It may not seem so to you now, being a girl only
and a girl in love,” her mother went on, “but there’s

“J.

something beyond even love, for a woman as well as a
man. A‘body’s personhood.”

Her mother’s gaze came back from the woods to
the yard and the house and the garden patch beyond,
and Lydia did not know how to answer all this strange
talk. The insects ticked and droned even louder around
them.

“Your papa has gentle ways not common to many
men. A man who is driven is not easy to live with.

The silence between them was longer.than the
words before Lydia said softly, “I never asked for easy,
Mama.”

“I know, I know.” Her mother turned suddenly
back to the crib and an armful of shucks. Her voice was
muffled. “I’m beseeching the Lord to hold you in the

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from “The Sacred
Turnip: Dietary Clues Gleaned from Tuber Traditions,” an
article by Ron Cowen that appeared in Science News (©1991
by Science Services, Inc.). The Blackfoot, or Sihasapa, are one
of the seven groups making up the Lakota Indian tribe of the
northern Great Plains.

Historians say the week-long sun dance adopted
by the Blackfoot confederacy of Montana and Alberta,
Canada, appears unique in that it gives special recog-
nition to a stringy, bulbous tuber called the prairie
turnip.

A Canadian ethnobotanist is now scrutinizing the
sun dance ceremony and other Blackfoot traditions in
search of clues to the prairie turnip’s role in daily tribal
life. So far, she says, the findings suggest that this
lowly legume earned its sacred status by serving as a
nutritional staple.

A key part of the Blackfoot sun dance began with
the transfer of a sacred bundle to a holy woman who
had pledged allegiance to the sun, says Sandra Peacock
of the Fort Calgary (Alberta) Historic Park. The bundle

-held special garments and accessories, including a
wooden stick and a headdress of buffalo hide adorned
with feathers and pendants of weasel skins. According
to tribespeople interviewed by Peacock, the ‘stick
symbolized the tool used to unearth the prairie turnip,
while the feathers represented turnip leaves.

A 1957 photograph of a Blackfoot holy woman
depicts an additional adornment: a bunch of dried,
twisted roots tied to the headdress. That photo, Peacock
says, sparked her fascination with the prairie turnip.

Despite its name, the prairie turnip (Psoralea
esculenta) bears little resemblance to the more familiar
root vegetable known as the turnip (Brassica rapa).
The latter is not a legume and has a more rounded,
smooth appearance than the elongated, scraggly prairie
turnip, which resembles a skinny potato.

Historical reports from the 1800s and early 1900s
indicate that Plains Indians, especially those living in
the more prairie-like regions south of Montana, once
cultivated P. esculenta widely. The three tribes of the
Blackfoot confederacy—the Piegan, the Blood and the
Blackfoot—do not eat the prairie turnip today, but
Peacock says the plant’s extensive roots in Blackfoot
legend and language strongly suggest that it once
tanked along with buffalo meat as.a vital element in
their diet.

Peacock speculates that ceremonies and legends
depicting the prairie turnip as sacred may reflect the
tribes’ need to conserve the plant, which the nomadic
Blackfoot may have had difficulty harvesting as they
moved from one site to the next. On the other hand, she
notes, Blackfoot elders recall that any tribe member
could dig up the tuber without restriction.

ACT-55C-SAMPLE

The vegetable’s prevalence in tribal customs could
50 also signify that it held special status in the Blackfoot
diet, Peacock suggests.

In an attempt to determine the prairie turnip’s
dietary significance for the northern tribes,
[researchers] analyzed the tuber’s nutritional content.

55 Their study found that the leguminous tubers contain
about 7 percent protein—much more than potatoes
(2 percent) and nearly as much as maize (9 percent).
The plant also contains a significant-amount of vitamin
C—17.1 milligrams per'100 grams, of weight. This

60 approaches the vitamin C concentrations in fresh citrus
fruits (25 to 30 mg per 100 g). Moreover, they said,
a flour made by pounding dried «prairie turnips
(a common tribal practice) would lose little of its
vitamin C during storage unless subjected to moisture.

65 The analysis suggested that P. esculenta “was
widely and regularly used [among tribes of the northern
plains] and formed a:valuable food resource of high
nutritional quality.”

'
Historical accounts from Canadian expeditions in

70 1857 and 1859 describe women and children harvesting
prairie turnips with fire-hardened, slightly curved
digging sticks. The tuber’s hard, dark skin was easily .
removed, exposing a white, fleshy interior. Some ate
the tuber raw; others boiled it, roasted it, or dried it and

75 then crushed it to a powder.

But scientists still lack definitive evidence of the
prairie turnip’s place in the prehistoric Blackfoot diet,
says Peacock, who maintains that most studies of tribal
lifestyles have instead focused on buffalo bones, and

80 occasionally the remains of medicinal plants..To clinch
the issue, she proposes that archaeologists undertake an
extensive search for the burnt remains of -P. esculenta
and other pit-roasted plants, since charring would have
protected them from chemical or bacterial degradation.

85 In the meantime, Peacock continues to compile
ethnographic data on the prairie turnip. This summer,
she hopes to witness her first sun dance and view the
full costume worn by the holy woman, replete with
headdress and digging stick.

11. According to the passage, the conclusions made about

the nutritional content of the prairie turnips were based
ona:

A. comparison of the protein'‘and vitamin C content
of the plant to that of other food crops.

B. presentation of the percentages of recommended
minimum daily requirements of various vitamins
and minerals contained in the plant.

C. study of the overall health of the Blackfoot people
relative to that of other Plains Indians.

D. chemical analysis of the- amounts of fats and
sugars present in the plant.

‘HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from Alice Walker's

autobiographical essay “In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens”
(©1974 by Alice Walker).

How was the creativity. of the Black woman kept
alive, year after year and century after century, when
for most of the years Black people have been in
America, it was a punishable crime for a Black person
to read or write? And the freedom to paint, to sculpt, to
expand the mind with action, did not exist. Consider, if
you can bear to imagine it, what might have been the
result if singing, too, had been forbidden by law. Listen
to the voices of Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina
Simone, Roberta Flack, and Aretha Franklin, among
others, and imagine those voices muzzled for life.

In the late 1920’s my mother ran away from home
to marry my father. By the time she was twenty, she
had two children and was pregnant with a third. Five
children later, I was born. And this is how I came to
know my mother: she seemed a large, soft, loving-eyed
woman who was rarely impatient in our home. Her
quick, violent temper was on view only a few times a
year, when she battled with the white landlord who had
the misfortune to suggest to her that her children did
not need to go to school.

She made all the clothes we wore, even my
brothers’ overalls. She made all the towels and sheets
we used. She spent the summers canning vegetables
and fruits. She spent the winter evenings making quilts
enough to cover all our beds.

During the “working” day, she labored beside—
not behind—my father in the fields. Her day began
before sunup, and did not end until late at night. There
was never a moment for her to sit down, undisturbed, to
unravel her own private thoughts; never a time free
from interruption—by work or the noisy inquiries of
her many children. And yet, it is to my mother—and all
our mothers who were not famous—that I went in
search of the secret of what has fed that muzzled and
often mutilated, but vibrant, creative spirit that the
Black woman has inherited, and that pops out in wild
and unlikely places to this day.

But when, you will ask, did my overworked
mother have time to know or care about feeding the
creative spirit?

The answer is so simple that many of us have
spent years discovering it. We have constantly looked
high, when we should have looked high—and low.

For example: in the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C., there hangs a quilt unlike any other
in the world. In fanciful, inspired, and yet simple and
identifiable figures, it portrays the story of the
Crucifixion. It is considered rare, beyond price. Though
it follows no known pattern of quiltmaking, and though
it is made of bits and pieces of worthless rags, it is
obviously the work of a person of powerful imagination

and deep spiritual feeling. Below this quilt I saw a note
that says it was made by “an anonymous Black woman
55 in Alabama a hundred years ago.”

If we could locate this “anonymous” Black woman
from Alabama, she would turn out to be one of our
grandmothers—an artist who left her mark in the only
medium her position in society allowed her to use.

60 And so it is, certainly, with my own mother.
Unlike Ma Rainey’s songs, which retained their cre-
ator’s name even while blasting forth from Bessie
Smith’s mouth, no song or poem will bear my mother’s
name., Yet so many of the stories that I write, that we
65 all write, are my mother’s stories. Only recently did I
fully realize this: that through years of listening to my
mother’s stories of her life, I have absorbed not only
the stories themselves, but something of the manner in
which she spoke, something of the urgency that
70 involved the knowledge that her stories—like her life—
must be recorded.

But the telling of these stories, which came from
my mother’s lips as naturally as breathing, was not the
only way my mother showed herself as’an artist. For

75 stories, too, were subject to being distracted, to dying
without conclusion. Dinners must be started, and cotton
must be gathered before the big rains. The artist that
was and is my mother showed itself to me only after
many years. This is what I finally noticed.

80 She planted ambitious gardens—and still does—

with over fifty different varieties of plants that bloom
profusely from early March until late November.

Before she left home for the fields, she watered her

flowers, chopped up the grass, and laid out new beds.

85 Whatever she planted grew as if by magic, and her

fame as a grower of flowers spread over three counties.

Because of her creativity with her flowers, even my

memories of poverty are seen through a screen of
blooms.

21. The passage suggests that the narrator’s mother, as

compared to the narrator’s father, performed:

A. less work in the fields.

B. more work in the fields.

C. the same work in the fields.

D. only what she could do when the children were not

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: The following passage is adapted from
an article by Lucia Jacobs titled “Cache Economy of the Gray
Squirrel” (©1989 by American Museum of Natural History).

In. the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
travelers in North America reported seeing armies of
squirrels, sometimes. numbering in the thousands,
making their way across fields, forests, and rivers.
These movements continued to amaze and appall the
citizenry -until the squirrels’ habitat, deciduous forest,
was greatly reduced in the late 1800s.

a

The gray squirrels’ migrations weré undoubtedly a
résponse to changes in their food supply. Their species
evolved in a virtual ocean of food trees—the ‘primeval
deciduous forest that. once covered the North American
continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi
River. The annual changes in the squirrels’ diet must
have been much the same then as they are now. In. the
spring, squirrels eat tree buds, tree flowers, and early
seeds, such as maple samaras. These provide energy
and key nutrients, such as calcium and sodium. But by
midsummer, food is scarce, and by late July, the squir-.
rels lose weight, resorting to such inferior foods as
mushrooms. With the coming of fall, however, the
mainstay of the squirrels’ diet—acorns and other.
nuts—appears. :

But even when the forests were at their most
extensive, and oaks and hickories in seemingly endless
supply, the fall harvest. was unpredictable. Oaks and
hickories produce huge crops of acorns and nuts, but
only at odd intervals. During some autumns, often those
following a late spring frost, which may kill the trees’
flowers, there is virtually no seed crop at all. Compiling
information from newspapers and travelers’ accounts,
A. W. Schorger showed how. squirrel migrations corre-
lated with years of poor seed production. His work,
published in 1949, showed that other species were-also
affected. by the trees’ crop failure; in acorn-poor years,
for example, newspapers reported free-running ‘hogs
starving to death in the forest.

Innumerable changes in the North American
‘landscape eventually brought an end to the great
squirrel migrations, although an occasional small
exodus has been observed in the twentieth century. The
gray squirrel is still, however, very-much affected by
fluctuations in nut crops.

40

As a tule, tree squirrels keep alive from fall until
spring by eating stored foods, while ground squirrels
hibernate. (Some squirrels, such as the eastern chip-
munk, do both.) But some tree squirrels have an easier
time of it than others. Those that live in evergreen
forests, such as the red squirrel of eastern and northern
forests and the chickaree of western forests, generally
gather pine cones and hoard them near their nests. Such
pine cones may not be abundant every year, but if cut
green and stored in a moist spot, they may last several
years. But gray and fox squirrels must replace their
stored food supplies every year, for acorns and nuts

55 germinate the-same. year they are buried. ‘When trees
fail to. produce many nuts, these squirrels’ reproductive
success, as well as survival itself, is jeopardized.

Given the gray squirrel’s.life-and-death depen-

dence on stored food, its manner of storing. may seem

60 oddly inefficient. Most food~ storing mammals maintain

either'a single larder or a mix. of central larder and

many spread-out smaller caches.’ Eastern chipmunks,

for example, keep a large underground store in their

burrows. and, as this is depleted, turn to scattered sur-

65 face stores to replenish it. The gray squirrel’s habit of

burying each nut separately—called scatter-hoarding—

seems. cumbersome. Why does this squirrel avoid
putting all its “eggs” in one basKet?

Christopher Smith, of, the University of Kansas,
70 has suggested that the distribution of nuts and acorns
and compétition. from other seed eaters, force gray
squirrels ‘to scatter-hoard. Because gray squirrels may
not know which trees will produce a big crop; the argu-
ment goes, each squirrel must forage over ‘a large area
75 each year. Such.a large area cannot be exclusive, as
other squirrels inevitably arrive to harvest seeds from
the masting: treés. For that-matter, even small areas
cannot be defended against ‘an influx of competing
squirrels, so the only chance is to cover a lot of terri-

80 tory.

Support for this theory comes from Hélén Lair, of
the University of Laval, who observed red squirrels in
Quebec and found that they put food ‘in larders only
when it was abundant and easily: harvested from an area

85 small enough to be subsequently defended. Otherwise,
they acted like gray squirrels, scattering many small,
hidden, undefended caches.

31. The author likens gray squirrels of the eighteenth and

nineteenth centuries to “armies” in line 2 because these
animals:

A. struggled to survive when food was scarce.
B. defended their territories against invaders.
C. stored their supplies in underground caches.
D. traveled in large groups.

32. The author calls the gray squirrel’s method of storing

food. “oddly inefficient” in line 60 because these
squirrels:

F.. migrate across fields and forests in search of food.

G. bury each of their nuts in a separate hole.

H. often cannot remember where their food is buried.

J. keep an underground store of food.

Passage Ill

When an object falls from a low altitude to Earth and
gravity is the only force acting upon it, the object will have
an acceleration of 9.8 meters/second’ (m/sec”).

Using a stopwatch that is accurate to the nearest
0.01 sec, students measured the times for 2 spheres to fall
to Earth and used these times to calculate the spheres’
acceleration.

Experiment 1

The students measured the times required for a 200 g
wooden sphere and a 50 g plastic sphere to fall 2.5 m to
Earth. The spheres had equal radii. (Note: A. sphere’s
surface area is proportional to its: radius squared; its
volume is proportional to its radius cubed.) The results are

' shown in Table 1.

Passage IV

All multicellular animals can be grouped within the
subkingdom Metazoa. Most metazoans are bilaterally
symmetrical (they have right and left halves that are nearly
identical). Biologists agree that metazoans evolved from
protozoans (single-celled organisms) over 600 million
years ago, but they do not agree on how this occurred.
Three theories are presented.

Cellularization Theory

Some biologists believe that metazoans evolved from
multinucleated protozoans (protozoans with many nuclei).
Separate cells formed when membranes developed between
adjacent nuclei. Later, cilia (hairlike structures), used for
movement, grew from each cell. These ciliated protozoan
ancestors then evolved into aquatic, bilaterally symmetrical
metazoans similar to modern flatworms. Later, other
metazoans evolved from these flatworm-like creatures (see
Figure 1).

membranes

cilia

first flatworm-type metazoan

Figure 1

Colonial Theory

Other biologists suggest that many protozoans
grouped together into a hollow ball, or colony. This colony
evolved into the first metazoan. Each cell in the colony had
a flagellum (movable tail) for movement. Initially, some of
these cells were better suited for reproduction, and these
became the reproductive cells of the metazoan. The first
metazoans were aquatic, flagellated, radially symmetrical
organisms (body parts arranged symmetrically around a
central point, as in modern jellyfish). All later metazoans
evolved from these jellyfish-like organisms (see Figure 2).

Separate Line Theory

Proponents of this theory argue that 2 separate
protozoan lines led to metazoans. Radially symmetrical
metazoans evolved from flagellated, colonial protozoans.
Bilaterally symmetrical metazoans evolved from ciliated,
multinucleated protozoans. The first metazoans of each
group were jellyfish-like creatures and flatworm-like
creatures, respectively. The 2 protozoan groups were only
distantly related to each other, and the evolution of aquatic
metazoans from the 2 protozoan groups occurred
independently and at different times.

Rain. causes’ sediment runoff (erosion) of rangelands,
which is affected by vegetation (grasses, leaves, and
branches) and animal trampling. Scientists conducted 2

experiments using identical-sized plots of soil with slight .

slopes. Two soils that differed primarily in their sand
content were used. Soil 1 contained 60% sand and Soil 2
contained 25% sand. Sprinklers simulated rainfall. It was
noted that rain first collected in soil depressions, such: as
hoofprints, then overflowed and eroded the soil. Sediment
runoff was measured at the bases of the plots in grams per
square meter (g/m), following 1 hour of rain.
Experiment 1 .
Vegetation cover was simulated using window screens
having various mesh sizes, The larger the number of mesh
squares per inch, the greater the simulated vegetation
cover. One plot was left uncovered, and screens of various
mesh sizes covered the other plots. Table 1 shows the
sediment runoff from each plot.

Experiment 2

Animal trampling was simulated by leading
a 500-kilogram (kg) cow back and forth over 2 plots of
each soil type until 30% of one and 60% of the other were
covered with hoofprints. One additional plot of each soil
type was left untrampled. Rainfall was simulated as in
Experiment 1. The-depth of water stored in hoofprints, in
centimeters (cm), is shown in Table 2, and the sediment
runoff produced by erosion is shown in Table 3.

Scoring Your Sample Test

How to Score the Sample Test
The remainder of this booklet provides scoring

keys and score conversion tables. Follow the instruc- :

tions below and on the following pages to score the
sample test and review your performance.

Raw Scores .

The number of questions you answered correctly
on each test and in each subscore area is your raw
score. Because there are many forms. of the ACT,
each containing different questions, some, forms will
be slightly easier (and some slightly, harder) than
others: A raw score of 57 on one form of the English
Test, for example, may be about as difficult to earn.as
a raw Score of.60 on another form of that test:

To compute your raw scores, check your answers
with the scoring keys on pages 55-57. Count the
number of correct answers for each of the four tests
and seven subscore areas, and enter the numbers in
the blanks provided: on.those pages. These numbers
are your raw scores on the tests and subscore areas.

Scale Scores

To adjust for the small differences that occur
among different forms of the ACT, the raw scores for
tests and subscore areas are converted into scale
scores. Scale scores are printed on the reports. sent
to-you and your college and scholarship choices.

When your raw scores are converted into scale
scores; it becomes possible to compare your. scores
with those. of examinees who completed different test
forms. For example, a scale score of 26 on the
English Test has the same meaning regardiess of the
form of the ACT on which it is based.

To determine the scale scores corresponding to.
your raw scores on the sample test, use the score
conversion tables,on pages 58-59.. The table on
page 58 shows the raw-to-scale score conversions
for the total tests, and the table on page 59 shows the
taw-to-scale score conversions for the subscore
areas. Because each form of the ACT Assessment is
unique, each form has somewhat different conversion
tables. Consequently, these tables provide only
approximations of the raw-to-scale score conversions
that would apply if a different form of the ACT
Assessment were. taken. Therefore, the scale scores
Obtained from the sample test. would’not be expected
to match precisely the scale scores received from a
national administration of the ACT Assessment.

Percent At or Below

Even scale scores don’t tell the whole story of
your test performance. You may want to know how
your ‘scores compare. to the scores of other students
who take the ACT. .

The norms table (Table 3.on page 60) enables

_ you to comparé your scores on the. sample test with

the scores.of recent high school graduates who tested
as sophomores, juniors, or seniors. The numbers .
reported in Table’3 are cumulative percents. A cumu-

_ lative percent is the’ percent of students who scored

at or below a given score. For example, a Composite
score of 20 has a cumulative percent of 49. This

_. means that 49% of the ACT-tested high school stu- .
_ dents hada Composite score of 20 or-lower.

Remember: that your scores and. percent at or

‘below on the sample tests are only. estimates of the

scores that you will obtain on an actual form of the
ACT. Test scores are only one indicator of your level

* of academic knowledge and ‘skills. Consider your

54

scores in connection with your grades, your perfor-.
mance in outside activities, and. your career interests.

"Reviewing Your Performance
on the Sample Test

After you have determined your scale scores and
cumulative percents, consider the following as you
evaluate how you did on the sample test.

* Did you run out of time before you completed a
test? Perhaps you need to adjust the way you used
your time in responding to the questions. It is to
your advantage to answer every question and pace
yourself so that youcando.so. ~ :

* Did’you spend too much time trying to understand
the directions to the tests? If so, réad the directions
for each test again thoroughly: The directions in the
sample test are exactly like the directions that will
appear in your test booklet on the test day. Make
sure you understand them now, so you won't have
to spend too much time studying them when ‘you -
take the actual test.

*. Review the questions. that you missed. Did you
select a response that was. an incomplete answer
or that did. not directly respond to the-question
being asked? Try to figure out what you overlooked
in answering the questions.

* Did a particular type of question confuse you? Did
the questions you missed come from a particular
gubscore area? In reviewing your responses to the
sample test, check to see whether a particular type
of question or a particular subscore area was more
dificult for you or took more of your time.

TABLE 1
Procedures Used to Obtain Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of.the four tests on which you marked
any responses, the total number of correct responses
yields a raw score. Use the table below to convert
your raw, scores to scale scores. For each test, locate
and circle your raw score or the range of raw.scores
that includes it in the table below. Then, read: across
to either outside colunin of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw, score. As
you determine your scale scores, enter them in the
blanks provided on the right. The highest possible
scale score for each test is 36. The lowest: possible
scale score for any test on which. you marked any
“responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging
the four scale scores. To do this, add your four scale
scores and divide the sum by 4. If the resulting num-
ber ends in a fraction, round it off to the nearest whole

number. (Round down any fraction-less than. one-half; ¢
‘round up any fraction that is one-half or more.) Enter +

this number in the. blank. This is your Composite
score. The highest possible Composite score.is 36.
The lowest possible Composite score is 1.
