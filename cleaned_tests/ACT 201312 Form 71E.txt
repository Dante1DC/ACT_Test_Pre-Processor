ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

PASSAGE |
The Greening of Winter
I love to snowboard, and, like most snowboarders
and skiers, I love to be outdoors during winter. However,
busy ski resorts can take a toll on the environment.
The clear-cutting of trees to create new ski runs

devastate fragile ecosystems and destroys
wildlife habitats. The effects don’t stop there.

People often drive—or in many cases fly—to their
favorite ski resorts. Long-distance travel generates CO,
emissions, which, ia turn, compound global warming.
Once at the resort, skiers and snowboarders tely on
extensive networks of energy-hungry chairlifts—gondolas

and high-speed quads—to whisk them up to the top of
a

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

[1] Ashley Bryan’s ABC of African American Poetry
honors twenty-five poems and one spiritual, “the root of
Black song and poetry,” Bryan writes in the introduction.
[2] Each page spotlights one poem and one letter of the
alphabet. [3] The work—celebrating poets Lucille Clifton,
Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, and others, invites
readers to be enriched by their own heritage or that of
another group, as the case may be. [4] Though his books
delve at times into somber subject matter—be it slavery,
the loss of a harvest, or a misunderstanding between
friends—each one emerges as an affirmation

of life. [5] That perspective is perhaps most

explicitly in evidence to be perceived in his
6

2007 work the name of it is Let it Shine; Three

Favorite Spirituals. [6] Here, in forty pages flooded
with color, Bryan leaves traces of tragedy. [7] However,
the overwhelming messages in the text and the images
are to embrace life, to honor oneself and others, and
freely giving to a larger world. [8] The “retired” Bryan
continues to do just that. “Each time I finish something,”
says the artist, “I can’t wait to start again and do

something even better.”

PASSAGE III
Edward Hopper: The Artist Who Painted Light
The American realist painter Edward Hopper

(1882-1967) loved light, in the 1920s, Hopper painted

Ef
pictures of cities and New England coastal regions in
which he captured varieties and intensities of light ranging

from brilliant afternoons to dusks to sinister nights. [=]

Hopper once stated that human figures interested
him less than the light in a scene he believed light was the
dramatic element that conveyed. vitality and immediacy
in a painting. “What I really want to do,” he said, “is to
paint sunlight on the side of a house.” In his Sun in an
Empty Room (1963), light coming from a single window

creates large rectangles that seems to inhabit the room.

Question 30 asks about the preceding passage
as a whole.

30. Suppose the writer’s goal had been to write an essay
about an artist with a long and successful career.
Would this essay accomplish that goal?

F. Yes, because it focuses on an artist and states that
his most popular books are based on his childhood
memories.

G. Yes, because it focuses on an artist with decades of
experience and many books, including award win-
nets, to his credit.

H. No, because even though it focuses on a successful
artist, it does not provide the exact publication
dates for each of his books.

J. No, because it focuses on what inspired a particu-
lar artist but does not indicate whether he was
successful.

C. light, during
D. light. In

light.

Party, a political group that sought to represent the

Lease to “stump” for them in the 1890 congressional

election campaigns. Lease accepted the invitation and,

during that year, delivered over 160 speeches for the party.

Quino checkerspot butterflies, each a red and black

flutter of stained glass, ranging along the Pacific coast

So, Parmesan has proposed a way to save the quarter-sized

butterflies and that doing so, maintain biodiversity. Her
Se

plan, however, is raising eyebrows [«].

Parmesan, along with others, advocates the use of

“assisted migration,” which is an interesting and relatively

7
new idea some biologists are considering. For migrating

67
checkerspots, there’s an additional problem: Los Angeles

lies directly in their path should they be inclined to try
68
migrating to cooler climates. Parmesan is transporting

cocoons north of L.A., hoping to augment the existing

population by moving cocoons from one place to the other.
6

[1] Opponents of assisted migration sight as
two deterrents the cost and the likelihood that human
interference could turn a species into an invasive pest.
[2] The cocoons are portable and, consequently, cheap to
transport. [3] Parmesan, though, thinks the checkerspot is
the perfect candidate for an assisted move. [4] She also
notes that the butterfly isn’t prolific enough to endanger

its adopted habitat. [-]

Passage |

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel The
Spirit of the Place by Samuel Shem (©2008 by Stephen J.
Bergman).

“Columbia! Next stop Columbia!”

With an iron inevitability, the Hudson Highlander,
northbound out of Grand Central Station, was veering
from a trestle out over the Hudson River back onto

5 land. Orville glanced out the right-hand window. At the
top of a hill he saw Olana, the Persian-turreted mansion
built by the nineteenth-century landscape painter
Frederick Church. Its limestone face was a creamy gold
against the lowering sun, and he felt the bite of nostal-

10 gia. Grabbing his backpack from the overhead rack, he
walked to the space between the cars. He would be
home in a couple of minutes.

No he would not. The train screeched, slowed, re-
screeched with a lot more oomph, shuddered, and
15 fought itself to a stop.

Orville and the other passengers waited. No infor-
mation was forthcoming. The air conditioning clicked
off. Figures, Orville thought, 1 come 4,000 miles from
Orta to Milan to Zurich to Kennedy to Grand Central

20 and then up the Hudson 128 miles—a whole day’s jour-
ney—and as soon as we poke up into the southern tip of
this hole of a town, things break.

After another fifteen minutes Orville had had
enough of the sweltering Amtrak car. Figuring it was
25 only a mile or so to town, he decided to walk. He
opened the door and jumped down from the car. The
wet heat smacked him in the face like a big sweaty
hand. Shouldering his backpack, he walked along the
cinders to the front of the train. There were two tracks.

30 Feeling good out in the unconditioned world, his
shoes striking the cross ties with soft, firm thunks,
Orville stretched his arms out to the dome of sky.
Taking a deep breath, he let his eyes ease down the
slopes of the Catskill mountains through the green,

35 shadowed foothills to the inlet at Catskill Creek with its
oil tanks and red neon sign for Mike’s Pizza and to the
river itself.

He heard a whistle, a train coming toward him,
southbound from Columbia. He moved off the inside
track to the track next to the river and watched it
approach. The engineer was waving at him in what at
first seemed a greeting, but as the train screamed past
he realized it was a warning. He jerked around. The
northbound train he’d just left was bearing down on
him, its own whistle masked by the other’s. Orville
jumped feet first into the river. The train thundered
past, shrieking like a lunatic.

Orville found his footing in the rocky shallows,
feeling the beats of hot air on his face. The train whis-
tles echoed back off the mountains. He was sore but
okay. As he hauled himself up onto the tracks, he
caught the acrid scent of creosote.

Creosote. Ail at once he saw himself as a six-year-
old, one summer’s day, lying on his back in a neglected
grassy field down the street from his house on Ten
Broek Lane. The scent of creosote was strong from the
railroad tracks running nearby. Alone, he stared up at
the clouds passing across the sky and suddenly had the
sense that the world as he was seeing it was only a part
of something else. For the first time in his life he saw
himself as part of some whole, some whole world to
which his own being was seamlessly connected. He felt
lighter, more alive, as if something else had clicked
on—or in. He leapt to his feet, making his legs go as
fast as they could, and ran home to tell his mother. He
burst into the kitchen and blurted out his discovery as
the screen door slammed—bam!—behind him.

Selma Ariel Fleischer Rose, a large, aproned shape
looming over the stove, didn’t respond.

He persisted, dragging a chair over, climbing up,
and telling her again, slowly and loudly.

“Something else! Mom, I’m part of something
else!”

Selma stared at him. He saw a cloud pass across
her gaze. She sighed. “Orville-doll, there’s nothing else
but this.”

The boy felt a rough, twisting pain in his chest. He

clenched down on it, trying to make it go away. He
fought back tears.

“What’s wrong, honey-bunny?”

Dread was rising, the pain was going. He felt him-
self numbing up, like his mouth did when he was at the
dentist’s. He broke eye contact. Feeling her fearful con-
cern, he said, “Nothing.” He turned and ran back out

85 the door.

Now, standing on the tracks, he realized how that
moment had been one end of the thread that had
unspooled all these years in a life spent running, a life
restless with questions.

90 Realizing that now there would be a breakage—
the train arriving, his sisters meeting it and not finding
him on it—he hurried on. As he rounded Mount Pecora,
the vista north opened up. There across the marsh was
his hometown, Columbia.

1. Based on the passage, the fact that the northbound
train passed Orville on its way to Columbia could be

considered. irqni¢, because Orville had just:
A. alerted the southbound train’s engineer that the

northbound train had stopped.

. decided to wait for the southbound train at a
nearby station.

. realized that he had left his backpack in the north-
bound train’s passenger car.
gotten off the northbound train in order to get td
town more quickly.

2. Which of the following events referred to in the pas-
sage occurred first chronologically?

FE. Orville jumped feet first into a river.

G. Orville lay on his back in a grassy field.

H. Orville left Grand Central Station.

J. Orville told his mother about a discovery he had
made.

3. It can most reasonably be inferred that Selma’s
response to Orville in lines 74-76 suggests that Selma
was:

. angered by Orville’s outburst.

anxious to talk to Orville about his concerns.
- worried about her other children.

. resigned to her situation in life.

4.

6.

According to the passage, Orville realized that he had
spent his life running and struggling with questions as
a direct result of a:

F, revelation he had had when he was a young adult.
G. crushing declaration made by his mother.

H. strong desire to escape his hometown.

J. fascination with traveling by train.

. Which of the following best describes the setting of the

last two paragraphs (lines 86-94)?

A. In the kitchen of Orville’s house

B. Alongside train tracks south of Columbia
C. Ata train station in Columbia

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the book
chapter “The Discovery and Settlement of Polynesia” by Dennis
Kawaharada (©1999 by University of Hawai'i).

Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa are islands of Polynesia.

The Polynesian migration to Hawai‘i was part of
one of the most remarkable achievements of humanity:
the discovery and settlement of the remote, widely scat-
tered islands of the central Pacific. The migration
began before the birth of Christ. While Europeans were
sailing close to the coastlines of continents before
developing navigational instruments that would allow
them to venture onto the open ocean, voyagers from
Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa began to settle islands in an
ocean area of over 10 million square miles. The settle-
ment took a thousand years to complete and involved
finding and fixing in mind the position of islands,
sometimes less than a mile in diameter on which the
highest landmark was a coconut tree. By the time Euro-
pean explorers entered the Pacific Ocean in the
16th century almost all the habitable islands had been
settled for hundreds of years.

The voyaging was all the more remarkable in that
it was done in canoes built with tools of stone, bone,
and coral. The canoes were navigated without instru-
ments by expert seafarers who depended on their obser-
vations of the ocean and sky and traditional knowledge
of the patterns of nature for clues to the direction and
location of islands. The canoe hulls were dug out from
tree trunks with adzes or made from planks sewn
together with a cordage of coconut fiber twisted into
strands and braided for strength. Cracks and seams
were sealed with coconut fibers and sap from breadfruit
or other trees. An outrigger was attached to a single
hull for greater stability on the ocean; two hulls were
lashed together with crossbeams and a deck added
between the hulls to create double canoes capable of
voyaging long distances.

The canoes were paddled when there was no wind
and sailed when there was; the sails were woven from
coconut or pandanus leaves. These vessels were sea-
worthy enough to make voyages of over 2,000 miles
along the longest sea roads of Polynesia, such as the
one between Hawai‘i and Tahiti. And though these
double-hulled canoes had less carrying capacity than
the broad-beamed ships of the European explorers, the
Polynesian canoes were faster: one of English explorer
Captain Cook’s crew estimated a Tongan canoe could
sail “three miles to our two.”

After a visit to the Society Islands in 1774, Span-
ish Captain Andia y Varela described the canoes he
saw: “It would give the most skilful [European] builder
a shock to see craft having no more breadth of beam
than three [arm] spans carrying a spread of sail so large
as to befit one of ours with a beam of eight or ten spans,
and which, though without means of lowering or furling
the sail, make sport of the winds and waves during a
gale. These canoes are as fine forward as the edge of a

knife, so that they travel faster than the swiftest of our
vessels; and they are marvellous, not only in this
respect, but for their smartness in shifting from one
tack to the other.”

The voyaging was by no means easy. There was
always a danger of swamping or capsizing in heavy
seas, of having sails ripped apart or masts and booms
broken by fierce winds, of smashing the hulls against
unseen rocks or reefs; and while there were grass or
leaf shelters on the decks of voyaging canoes, the voy-
agers were often exposed to the wind, rain, and sun,
with only capes of leaves or bark-cloth wrappings for
protection. A stormy night at sea, even in the tropics,
can be brutally chilling. If supplies ran short during a
long voyage, and no fish or rainwater replenished them,
then starvation became a possibility.

A long voyage was not just a physical, but a
mental challenge as well, particularly for a navigator
without compass or chart. To navigate miles of open
ocean required an extensive and intimate knowledge of
the ocean and sky. Captain Cook noted that Polynesian
navigators used the rising and setting points of celestial
bodies for directions.

To keep track of their position at sea during long
sea voyages, the navigators used a system of dead reck-
oning—memorizing the distance and direction traveled
until the destination was reached. Finding islands
before they could actually be seen was also part of the
art of navigation. Voyagers followed the flight of land-
dwelling birds that fished at sea as these birds flew
from the direction of islands in the morning or returned
in the evenings. The navigators also watched for
changes in swell patterns, clouds piled up over land,
reflections on clouds from lagoons, and drifting land
vegetation.

In the context of the passage, the phrase “sometimes
less than a mile in diameter on which the highest land-
mark was a coconut tree” (lines 13-14) primarily
serves to explain why:

there are many islands scattered throughout the
central Pacific.

similar vegetation exists on most islands in the
central Pacific.

early voyagers had difficulty locating islands in
the central Pacific.

European explorers searched for large, habitable
islands in the central Pacific.

As it is used in line 12, the phrase fixing in mind most
nearly means:

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the biography
Shout, Sister, Shout! The Untold Story of Rock-and-Roll Trail-
blazer Sister Rosetta Tharpe by Gayle F. Wald (©2007 by Gayle
F. Wald).

Sister Rosetta Tharpe, as she was professionally
billed, was not supposed to be a highlight of the fall
1938 Cotton Club revue, a fast-paced variety show
headlining Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers,
young dancers who thrilled audiences with their acro-
batic elegance. Originally, this emerging gospel singer
was just a gamble, signed by Herman Stark for two
weeks. Like other new attractions, Rosetta constituted
one part of a huge supporting cast, performers who
largely filled time between the big numbers. Early print
advertisements did not mention her name.

Yet from the outset, audiences were thrilled by
Rosetta’s unusual sound and style. Newspaper
reporters, white and black, struggled for the right words
to describe her. Most used some variation of “swing” to
convey the rhythmic quality of her music, calling her a
“swinger of spirituals,” a “spiritual swinging favorite,”
a “hymn swinging evangelist,” and a “hymmnswinger.”
The Chicago Defender called her “a swingcopated
manipulator of loud blue tones” and noted that “she
handles the guitar rather creditably in accompaniment.”

Still others compared Rosetta to Bessie Smith, the
blues singer whose career was cut short by a 1937 car
accident. Like Smith, Rosetta presented a compelling
picture of black female self-assurance and vigor when
she performed. Indeed, her “gospel blues” and Smith’s
secular blues were not all that distinct. Musically, both
sprang from sources in slave culture, and both con-
fronted the harshness of the world with determination
to “make a way outta no way.” For gospel singers, this
“way” was through God; for blues singers, it was
through self-reliance.

From October to December 1938, events of pro-
found and lasting significance to Rosetta’s career
occurred almost weekly. Irving Mills approached
Rosetta in mid-October and soon had her signed to an
“exclusive publishing contract” with Mills Music. A
company with an international distribution network,
Mills Music quickly published Eighteen Original Negro
Spirituals, an impressive booklet containing songs
“with an original and appealing religious quality set
down exactly as sung by Sister Tharpe since infancy in
Negro churches ali over the country.” Encompassing
such titles as “I Look Down the Road and I Wonder,”
“My Lord and I,” and “That’s Ail,” Eighteen Original
Negro Spirituals would serve as a crucial source of
Rosetta’s repertoire for the next thirty-five years.

Music publishing was important—as early gospel
entrepreneurs well understood—but it didn’t have the
glamour of sound recordings. Some of that glamour
became Rosetta’s when she signed a contract the same
month with Decca Records.

a

Decca had recorded songs by gospel singer
Mahalia Jackson in May 1937, but they did so poorly

55 that the label dropped her and didn’t venture back into

the gospel field until it took a chance on Rosetta seven-
teen months later. With her bell-like voice, winning
smile, and Cotton Club notoriety, Rosetta had the com-
bination of the musical goods and showbiz flair that
Mahalia had lacked. Her first records, recorded in a
single session on October 31, 1938, with Rosetta
accompanying herself on guitar, were instant successes.
How successful they were in hard numbers is difficult
to say, but successful enough to bring Rosetta back for
a second session in January 1939 and to keep her in
Decca’s employ, without interruption, until the mid-
1950s.

Rosetta’s first session reveals a young woman
capable of finding and communicating the emotional
core of a song through exquisite phrasing, inventive
vocal technique, and guitar playing of originality, con-
fidence, and grace. Her years of using her gift in live
performance had taught her how to make a listener feel
a song, not just hear it, by making use of vibrato, trills,
enunciation, dynamic variety (variations in loudness),
and melisma, a gospel hallmark in which the vocalist
sings several notes within the space of a single syllable.
Like a blues or jazz singer, Rosetta tended to sing
around the beat rather than on top of it, allowing for
thythmic complexity and improvisation. Like a blues
singer, too, she was capable of covering material of
enormous topical and emotional variety. Her first four
cuts for Decca range widely in tone, from the sassy
satire of “That’s All” to the wistful contentment of “My
Man and I” to the extroverted exuberance of “Rock
Me” and the longing of “The Lonesome Road.” All
bore the mark of a singer-player of extraordinary con-
trol and personality.

. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A. contrast the characteristics of gospel music and the
characteristics of blues music.

B. compare Tharpe’s gospel sound to that of other
popular gospel singers of her day.

C. explain how the careers of several musicians
inspired the work of an emerging gospel singer.

D. describe some of the significant events that
occurred early in Tharpe’s musical career.

. Based on the information in the first paragraph, the

role of Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers in the
1938 Cotton Club revue was most likely that of:

F. featured performers who were central to that
year’s program.

G. young performers who were critical of Thatpe’s

J. inexperienced performers who used the show to
develop new skills.

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“The Shakespeared Brain” by Philip Davis (©2006 by The
Reader).

The word semantic refers to the meaning a word or sentence
conveys. The word syntax refers to the grammatical structure of
a sentence.

The linguistic phenomenon in Shakespeare which
is known as ‘functional shift’ refers to the way that
Shakespeare will often use one part of speech—a noun
or an adjective, say—to serve as another, often a verb,
shifting its grammatical nature with minimal alteration
to its shape. Thus in Lear for example, Edgar compar-
ing himself to the king: ‘He childed as I fathered’
(nouns ‘child’ and ‘father’ shifted to verbs); in Troilus
and Cressida, ‘Kingdomed Achilles in commotion
rages’ (noun ‘kingdom’ converted to adjective).

Research suggests that there is one specific part of
the brain that processes nouns and another part that
processes verbs: but what happens when for a micro-
second there is a serious hesitation between whether, in
context, this is noun or verb?

With the help of my colleague in English lan-
guage, Victorina Gonzdlez-Diaz, as weil as scientists, I
designed a set of stimuli—40 examples of Shake-
speare’s functional shift. At this very early and rather
primitive stage, we could not give our student-subjects
undiluted lines of Shakespeare because too much in the
brain would light up in too many places: that is one of
the definitions of what Shakespeare-language does. So,
the stimuli we created were simply to do with the noun-
to-verb or verb-to-noun shift-words themselves, with
more ordinary language around them.

Around each of those sentences of functional shift
we also provided three counterexamples which were
shown on screen to the experiment’s subjects in random
order: all they had to do was press a button saying
whether the sentence roughly made sense or not. Thus,
below, A (‘accompany’) is a sentence which is conven-
tionally grammatical, makes simple sense, and acts as a
control; B (‘charcoal’) is grammatically odd, like a
functional shift, but it makes no semantic sense in con-
text; C (‘incubate’) is grammatically correct but still
semantically does not make sense; D (‘companion’) is a
Shakespearian functional shift from noun to verb, and
is grammatically odd but does make sense:

A) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said
you would accompany me.

B) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said
you would charcoal me.

C) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said
you would incubate me.

D) I was not supposed to go there alone: you said
you would companion me.

So far we have just carried out the EEG stage of
experimentation. EEG works as follows in its graph-

like measurements. When the brain senses a semantic
violation, it automatically registers what is called an
N400 effect, a negative wave modulation 400 millisec-
onds after the onset of the critical word that disrupts the
meaning of a sentence. The N400 amplitude is small
when little semantic integration effort is needed (e.g.,
to integrate the word ‘eat’ in the sentence ‘The pizza
was too hot to eat’), and large when the critical word is
unexpected and therefore difficult to integrate (e.g.,
‘The pizza was too hot to sing’).

But when the brain senses a syntactic violation,
there is a P600 effect, a parietal modulation peaking
approximately 600 milliseconds after the onset of the
word that upsets syntactic integrity. Thus, when a word
violates the grammatical structure of a sentence (e.g.,
‘The pizza was too hot to mouth’), a positive wave is
systematically observed.

Preliminary results suggest this:

(A) With the simple control sentence (‘you said you
would accompany me’), NO N400 or P600 effect
because it is correct both semantically and syntactically.

(B) With ‘you said you would charcoal me’, BOTH
N400 and P600 high because it violates both grammar
and meaning.

(C) With ‘you said you would incubate me’, NO P600
(it makes grammatical sense) but HIGH N400 (it makes
no semantic sense).

(D) With the Shakespearian ‘you said you would com-
panion me’, HIGH P600 (because it feels like a gram-
matical anomaly) but No N400 (the brain will tolerate
it, almost straightaway, as making sense despite the
grammatical difficulty). This is in marked contrast with
B above.

So what? First, it meant that ‘functional shift’ was
a robust phenomenon: that is to say, it had a distinct
and unique effect on the brain. Instinctively Shake-
speare was right to use it as one of his dramatic tools.
Second, the P600 effect continued after the word
(‘companion’) that triggered it. The brain was thus
primed to look out for more difficulty, to work at a
higher level, whilst still accepting that fundamental
sense was being made.

Shakespeare is stretching us; he is opening up the
possibility of further peaks, new potential pathways or
developments.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage

Passage li

Meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are mammals that typi-
cally live in groups of 2 to 30 individuals. Some group
members, called helpers, help parents care for their pups.
Figure 1 shows how the percent contribution to babysitting
and to pupfeediag by helpers varied with the age of the
helpers, as categorized in Table 1.

A helpet’s food intake, as measured by daily weight
gain (average number of grams gained by a helper per hour
during a 24 br day), can affect its contribution to pup care.
Figure 2 shows how the percent contribution to babysitting
and to pupfeeding by helpers older than 1 yr varied with
daily weight gain.

Passage II

Birds have existed since at least 120 million years ago
(mya), when Jeholornis was alive. Jeholornis, one of the
earliest birds known from fossils, had reptilian characteris-
tics (including teeth, a long bony tail, and claws) and bird-
like characteristics (including feathers, 3 digits on each
foot, hollow bones, and a beak). Two scientists discuss the
origin of the first birds.

Scientist 1

The first birds appeared 150 mya. They evolved from
a group of ground-dwelling, 3-toed dinosaurs known as
theropods. Like the more recent Jeholornis, theropods had
long bony tails, teeth, and claws. Theropods had 23 skele-
tal features that were identical.to the corresponding skele-
tal features of the first birds.

Although theropods could not fly, a 225-million-year-
old fossil of a feather-covered theropod has shoulder joints
that show the theropod could fold its forelimbs close to its
body the way a bird folds its wings. The first birds had a
nearly identical shoulder joint and could fly. Fossils of
other feather-covered, nonflying theropods that predated
Jeholornis have also been discovered.

Scientist 2

The first birds appeared 220 mya. They evolved from
a group of tree-dwelling reptiles known as archosaurs
instead of from dinosaurs. Some archosaurs could glide to
the ground; others could also fly. The 230-million-year-old
fossil of an archosaur indicates that the archosaur had
numerous elongated scales along its front limbs. Those
scales had some characteristics identical to those of feath-
ers. This archosaur could have glided from trees to the
ground, as could Jeholornis. Theropods could not be
the ancestors of birds, because theropods lived only on the
ground.

The fact that some skeletal features of theropods were
identical to those of the first birds is not evidence that
theropods were the most recent ancestors of birds. Instead,
these features are independent adaptations to similar habi-
tats. A study matched each of the 3 digits on the feet of
theropods and on the feet of the first birds to one of the
5 digits on the feet of various earlier reptiles. Theropods
had the Ist, 2nd, and 3rd digits of the original 5 digits,
whereas the first birds had the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th digits.

11. Consider Scientist 2’s statement about why theropods
could not be the ancestors of birds. That statement
would be most strongly contradicted if it were discov-
ered that theropods typically:

A. ate plants.

B. tended to their young.
C. climbed trees.

D. burrowed in the ground.

12. Both scientists would disagree with the statement that

birds existed how many million years ago?

EF. 75 mya
G. 150 mya
BH. 175 mya
J. 250 mya

provides evidence of a possible bird ancestor that:

was covered with elongated scales.
was covered with feathers.

could glide.

14. Fossils of Jeholornis are considered very unusual
because they show a characteristic of early birds that is
rarely fossilized. This characteristic is most likely

which of the following?

EK Claws
G. Beak
H. Leg bones
J. Feathers

15. By discussing the elongated scales indicated by the
230-million-year-old archosaur fossil, Scientist 2 is
most likely implying which of the following? The
elongated scales possessed by members of that group
of archosaurs:

A. were used by those archosaurs to grasp prey.

B. were used by those archosaurs to climb trees.

C. evoived into the feathers of a descendant of those
archosaurs.

evolved from the feathers of the most recent
ancestor of those archosaurs.

16. Suppose further fossil evidence reveals that the digits
on the feet of theropods actually corresponded to the
2nd, 3rd, and 4th digits, instead of the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd digits, on the feet of earlier reptiles. This discovery
would better support the viewpoint of which scientist?

F. Scientist 1, because this discovery would provide
more evidence that the first birds and theropods
are not closely related.

G. Scientist 1, because this discovery would provide
more evidence that the first birds and theropods
are closely related.

more evidence that the first birds and archosaurs
are not closely related.

are closely related.

17. Theropods are thought to have been endothermic (con-
trolling body temperature by internal means), whereas
archosaurs are thought to have been ectothermic (con-
trolling body temperature by external means). This
information supports the viewpoint of which scientist?
A. Scientist 1, because birds are endothermic.

Five 2.5 mx 2.5 m platforms (1 gravel platform,
1 media platform, and 3 vegetated platforms) were con-
structed at a location on a building’s roof. The gravel plat-
form had a 2 cm layer of gravel over a waterproof fabric (a
typical roof covering) and was unsloped. The media plat-
form had all the layers as shown in the cross section except
for the plants and was unsloped. The vegetated platforms
had all the green roof layers as shown. One vegetated plat-
form had a slope of 2.0%, another had a slope of 6.5%, and
the third was unsloped (0% slope).

A mnoff collection device was attached to each plat-
form and a rain gauge was mounted on the roof. Two stud-
ies over a 2-month period measured the runoff from the
platforms after each of 21 rain events, all lasting 60 min or
more.

Study 1

For each of the 3 unsloped platforms, the amount of
runoff in the collection device was recorded every 10 min
for 180 min following the start of each rain event. Figure 1
shows the cumulative runoff from the platforms for a
selected representative light, moderate, and heavy rain
event. The 3 rain events produced a total rainfall of
0.5 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm, respectively, over the 180 min.

Passage VI

When 1-bromobutane (C,HoBr) and sodium iodide
(Nal) are dissolved together in a solvent—acetone or ace-
tonitrile—they react to form 1-iodobutane (C4Hol) and
sodium bromide (NaBr):

C,HBr + Nal — C,Hgl + NaBr

NaBr is not very soluble in either solvent, so as NaBr
forms, it alone precipitates from the reaction solution. The
reaction can be monitored by measuring the conductivity
(ability to conduct electrical current) of the reaction solu-
tion because Nal is the only component that significantly
contributes to the solution’s conductivity.

Students did 3 experiments to study the rate of this
reaction.

Experiment 1

A probe was used to measure (in millisiemens per
centimeter, mS/cm) the conductivities of solutions with
different Nal concentrations (in millimoles per liter,
mmol/L) in acetone or in acetonitrile at 40°C (see
Figure 1). This trial was repeated twice, once at 30°C and
once at 20°C. The results did not significantly differ from
those at 40°C.

Passage VII

The 3 primary interactions between photons (particles
of light) and matter are:

* the Compton effect: A photon collides with, and gives
some of its energy to, a free electron (e"). The photon
and e are scattered away from the collision site.

the photoelectric effect: A photon is absorbed by, and
gives all of its energy to, an e” bound to an atom. The e
is scattered away from the atom.

* pair production: A photon passes close to an atom and is
transformed into an e” and a positron (e*, a particle with
the same mass as an e’, but the opposite charge), con-
verting energy to mass. The é and e’ are scattered away
from the nearby atom.

Study 1

A slab of carbon (C) surrounded by particle detectors
was bombarded by photons that each had an energy
between 0.01 million electron volts (MeV) and 100 MeV.
When an incident photon interacted with the slab and scat-
tered 1 or more particles into the detectors, a successful
event was registered. When the photon passed through the
slab without interacting, an unsuccessful event was regis-
tered. In each successful event, the energy of the incident
photon and the type(s) of scattered particle(s) were
recorded. When 500,000 successful events had occurred,
data from these events were then used to calculate the rela-
tive probability (P) for each known type of photon-matter
interaction to occur at various incident photon energies.
Plots of P versus incident photon energy for the 3 primary
interactions are shown in Figure 1.
