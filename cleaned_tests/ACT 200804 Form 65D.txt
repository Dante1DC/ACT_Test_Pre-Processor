While many cultures had their variations of the yo-yo,

the American version can be traced to the Philippines,

where yo-yos have been a national pastime for centuries.

In fact, the name yo-yo is a Tagalog g word that translates

as
ca

“come back.” In the 1920s Pedro Flores, a Filipino

immigrant, introduced the toy in the United States and

soon

started a yo-yo manufacturing company in California.

Flores’s design was different because the yo-yo’s string.

‘The American craze for the toy began when the

Flores’s new yo-yo. Noticing the large crowd who

watched, Duncan quickly realized the yo-yo’s potential.

Flores sold his yo-yo company and all rights to Duncan

in 1932, after deciding that he was more interested in
teaching people how to handle yo-yos than he was

in manufacturing them. Duncan immediately launched
an elaborate national advertising campaign to promote
the toy. He also sent Duncan Yo-Yo. Professionals

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel
Toning the Sweep by Angela Johnson (©1993 by Angela
Johnson}. .

‘
The narrator is visiting her grandmother, Ola, to help her pre-
pare to move. Martha is Ola’s friend and neighbor.

I think about how everybody Ola khows here has a
story: Daddy says that everybody has one and their sto-
ries are all a part of us. If Ola loves these people, then
they must be a-part of me too. It must be true about all
of us being a.part of one another like Daddy says.

Ola hums on the porch while Mama eats an apple
and labels boxes. I go over to the phone by the refriger-
ator and-call Martha. When she picks up, her voice

rings out and is so familiar. I tell her Olas 3 idea about: |

making a movie.

Martha Jackson's hair is the color of coal and she
must be about my grandmama’s age. She cuts her hair
short, and sometimes it sticks straight’up, but she
doesn’t care.

She’s probably one of the tallest people 1 know,
and walks like she’s swimming. Martha looks. at you for
a long time before she decides to speak.

She’s leaning.on a Joshua tree in Ola’s front yard,

saying, “It’s like poetry and eating to me now. You let _

the camera become part of you. Like your head and
your eyes. If the camera were to fall out of your hands,
it should be like your head falling off in the middle of a

- conversation.”

“I don’t know if the camera can ever be that spe-
cial to me, Martha,” I say. “I just got used to the camera
my dad gave me four years 280. T can remember to take
off the lens cap sometimes.” :

Martha smiles. “This is a thing to get used to— :

that’s all, No magic, no special real training. Turn the
camera on and shoot.”

I take the. camera and start taping a crow that’s

landed on the back porch. I figure it’s a start, The crow,
gets real interested in me filming him and stops pecking”

at the old apple core he’s found near the’ garbage cans.
He hops off the-porch and checks me and the cainera
out till he sees something else off over by some brush.

Martha’s watching me. with a smirk when I turn
back to her with the camera. “I.guess you'll do okay by
yourself now.” She looks at me for-a long time, then
says, “Let’s talk about Ola.”

I start shooting and say to myself, “A part of me,”
and hope that the thing is going afd the Jens cap hasn’t
been.on the whole time I’ve been taping the crow. I
zoom in on Martha leaning against the Joshua tree. She
stares into the camera,

“[ met Ola in the late’ summer of 1964 “cause there
was no other way around it.”

A pot falls in the kitchen, and we can hear Ola
Jaughing—then she stops: I keep the camera running.

“Like I was saying,” Martha starts to whisper, but

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted. from the articie
“The Trouble with Fries” by Malcoim Gladweli (©2001 by’ The
Condé Nast Publications Inc.).

It is entirely possible, right now, to make a deli-
cious French fry that does not carry with it a death sen-
tence. A French fry can be much 1 more than a delivery
vehicle for fat.

Is it really that simple, though? Consider the cau-

tionary tale of the-efforts of a group of food scientists at
Auburn University more than a decade ago to come up
with a better hamburger. The Auburn team wanted to
create a leaner beef that tasted as good as regular
ground beef, They couldn’t just remove the fat, because
that would leave the meat dry and mealy. They wanted
to replace the fat. The goal of the Auburn scientists was
to cut about two-thirds of the fat from‘normal ground

-beéf, which meant that they needed to find something

to add to the beef that would hold an equivalent amount
of water—and continue to retain that water even as the

beef was being grilled. Their choice? Seaweed, or,

more precisely, carrageenan. They also selected’ some
basic flavor enhancers, desigtied to make up for the lost
fat “taste.” The result was a beef patty that was roughly
three-quarters water, twenty per cent.protein, five per
cent or so fat, and a quarter of a per cent seaweed. They
called it AU Lean.

It didn’t take the Auburn scientists long to realize
that they had created something special. They began
doing blind taste comparisons of AU Lean burgers and
traditional twenty-per-cent-fat burgers. Time after time,

the AU Lean burgers won. Next, they took their inven- |

tion into the field: They. récruited a hundred families
and supplied them with three kinds of ground beef for
home cooking over consecutive three-week intervals—
regular “market” ground beef with twenty per cent fat,
ground beef. with five per cent fat, and AU Lean. The
families were asked to rate the different kinds of beef,
without knowing which was which. Again, the :AU
Lean won hands down.

What the Auburn team showed was. that, even
though people love the taste and feel of fat—and natu-
rally gravitate toward high-fat food—they can. be
fooled into thinking there is a lot of fat in something
when there isn’t. When the group tried to lower the fat
in AU Lean below five per cent, people didn’t like it
anymore. But, within the relatively broad range of
between five and twenty-five per cent, you can add
water and some flavoring and most people can’t tell the
difference.

What's more, people appear.to. be more sensitive
to the volume of food they consume than to its calorie
content. Barbara Rolls, a nutritionist at Penn State, has
demonstrated this principle with satiety studies. She
feeds one group of people a high-volume snack and
another group a. low-volume snack. Even though the
two snacks have the same calorie count, she finds that

ACT-650

55

80

‘90

ik

people who eat the high-volume snack feel more satis-
fied. Eating AU Lean, in short, isn’t going to leave you
with a craving for more calories; you'll feel just'as full.

For anyone looking to improve the quality of fast
food, all this is heartening news. It means that you
should be able to put low-fat cheese and low-fat.may-
onnaise in a fast-food: hamburger without anyone’s
complaining. It also means that there’s no particular
reason to use twenty-per-cent-fat ground beet i in a fast-
food burger, In 1990, using just this argument, the
‘Auburn team suggested to McDonald’s that it make a
hamburger out of AU Lean. Shortly thereafter, McDon-
ald’s came out with the McLean. Deluxe. Other fast-
food houses scrambled to, follow suit, Nutritionists
were delighted. And fast food appeared on the verge of
arevolution.

‘Only, it wasn’t. The McLean was a flop, and four
years later it was off the market. What happened? Part
of the problem appears to have been that McDonald’s
rushed the burger to market before many of the produc-
tion kinks had been worked. out. Mote important,
though, was the psychological handicap the burger
faced."People liked AU Lean in blind taste tests because
they didn't know it was AU Lean; they were fooled into
thinking it was regular ground beef. But nobody was
fooled when it came to the McLean Deluxe. It was sold
as the healthy choice--and who goes to McDonald's for
health food? .

This is sobering news for those interested in
improving the American diet. For years; the nutrition
movement in this country has made transparency one of
its principal goals: it has assumed that the bést way to
help people improve their diets is to tell them precisely
what’s in their food, to label certain foods good and
certain foods bad. But transparency can’ backfire,
because sometimes nothing is more deadly for our taste
buds than the knowledge that what we are eating is
good for us.

The author most nearly portrays the Auburn scientists
as: .

A. severe critics of the fast-food industry’s practices.

B.. enthusiastic promoters of their promising work.

C. diligent researchers uninterested in the practical
application of their work.

D. clever innovators more interested in nutrition than
in how food tastes.

Passage Ili

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted, from The Piano Shop _

on the Left Bank by Thad Carhart (©2001 by Thad Carhart).

No one knows exactly when the: piano was

.. invented. The gerierally accepted date is around 1700.
There is little doubt, however, about its inventor, an
instrument maker in Florence, Italy, named Bartolomeo
Cristofori, who developed -a way of making a struck
string resound loudly. Before Cristofori, keyboard
instruments were unsatisfactory for different reasons:
clavichords, whose sttings are struck, were small and
delicate, and their greatly reduced volume made them
10 suitable only for small gatherings. Harpsichords, while
“larger and therefore considerably louder, had one over-
riding limitation: since the string is plucked, the force
with. which the key is depressed is unrelated to the

a

volume of the sotind produced. Dynamic control’ of

15 each note was not possible.

What was needed—and what Cristofori invented-—
was an instrument as large and robust as the big harpsi-
chords that would also allow the dynamic-range that
before had only been available on the flimsy clavi-
chords. The first piano was described by a contempo-
gary musician in 1711 as a “gravicembalo col piano e
forte,” a “harpsichord with soft and loud.” This was the
essential breakthrough, but it took decades for the seed
to find fertile ground, and it did s6.not in Italy but in
' 28, eighteenth-century Germany.

2

Ss

German instrament - makers incorporated
Cristofori’s breakthrough into a series of increasingly
powerful keyboard instruments that were true pianos.
Johann Sebastian Bach was inipressed by the first piano

* 80 he tried, but he pointed out limitations that still needed
to be worked on: a heavy action and a treble that was
not loud enough. Two of his sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel
and Johatin Christian, championed the instrument in the

, hext generation; by the time Johann Christian Bach

35 gave England's first solo piano performance in 1768,

the triumph of this. new keyboard instrument over the
harpsichord was assured,

The role of the keyboard as a solo instrument came

to the fore musically. It was'no longer just another part

40 of the ensemble, and its unique volume freed it from
the confines of the drawing room to which the harpsi-

chord had almost always been consigned. Haydn and.

Mozart both wrote masterful sonatas for the new instru-
ment, its keyboard was’ greatly expanded, and its

45 dynamic range-—the single feature that most distin-
guished it from the harpsichord—was exploited fully. A
whole new technique stressing fluidity was: developed
for the piano, and. Mozart wrote: “It should flow like
oil.” Solo. concerts became the norin rather than the

50 exception, and a class of instrumentalists with tech:
ique and power arrived on the scene.

What had been a tinkerer’s offshoot among harpsi-
chord makers became an industry in its own right.
London'and Vienna were its focal points. The two capi-

55 tals gave rise to distinct schools of piano building, the

principal difference having to do with how the action—
the intricate mechanism that, activates the hammers to
strike the strings—was conceived and assembled. Vien-
nese pianos were generally softer, with- a: refined
singing tone that allowed the melody to come to the
. fore; the piarios themselves had delicate cabinetry. Eng-
lish pianos, on the other hand, had-a more robust tone,
with a stronger ‘action and greater tension in the strings; *
they had solid cases and sturdy frames, The great Vien-
65 nese composers of the classical era—Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven—played Viennese pianos, but the transition
to the stronger instriments of the English school can be
seen in Beethoven’s last piano sonatas.

: Beethoven was-known for the increasing dynamic
70 contrasts in’ his works for piano, from whisper to thun-.
der, and he sometimes destroyed the fragile Viennese .
pianos when playing his music. He had a sttong influ-
ence on the direction of piano manufacture, and as early
as 1796 he expressed his frustration with the overly
delicate styles of Playing that were a holdover from
harpsichords. . . ,

7

G

In. 1818, Broadwood, the pre-eminent English
mantfacturer of the day, offered him a grand piano that -
incorporated all of the Jatest features: stronger case and

80 frame, trichord stringing, more responsive action. This
piano, too, Beethoven damdged with the fervor of. his
playing (a contemporary reported that “the brokea
strings were jumbled up like a thorn bush.in a storm”), -
but he remained attached to it until his death in 1827.

85 He imagined music unlike ariything his contemporaries

period still strikes many as a revelation of the piano’s
extreme limits of power and expressiveness.

NATURAL SCIENCE; This, passage is adapted from Great
Waters: An Atlantic Passage by Deborah Cramer (©2001 by
Deborah Cramer).

Relative newcomers to the marine world, bluefin +

tuna and swordfish have evolved into some of the sea’s
most highly developed fishes. While the cod, haddock,
flounder, and plaice who dwell year-round in the North
Sea.and the Gulf of Mexico are cold-blooded, their
body temperatures rising and falling in synchrony with
‘the ‘surrounding water, thus limiting their geographic
range, swofdfish and bluefin, exquisitely adapted to
live in the vastness of the sea, are free from the bound-
40 aries imposed by temperature, The swordfish who sur-
‘face at the. shelf edge havé swum up from the depths,
rising hundreds of feet through the water each evening
ag the sun sets, following their prey of fish and squid. A
temperature difference of 36 degrees Fahrenheit, as
16 great as the swing between winter and summer, night
and. day, separates cold deep from warm surface.
Swordfish exit one realm and swim into the other in
under an hour,

a

Moving between such extremes would stun the

_ 20: nervous system of a cold-blooded fish, but these ocean
princes make their own heat, warming themselves in

the deep cold. The burner of the swordfish lies behind

its eyes, below its brain, a dark mass of tissue sur-

rounded by insulating fat, heavy with blood, and loaded .

26 with energy-producing mitochondria. With warm brain
and eyes, swordfish can chase their food in waters deep
and shallow, near and distant. By night, they feed at the

surface, at the edge of the deep water. By day, they .

move onto shallow banks, like Georges or the Grand
Banks, and dive down-to feed, slashing through schools
of menhaden and mackerel with their long, sharp
swords. . .

Ks

3

Bluefin tuna thrive in waters as cold as 40 ‘degrees
Fahrenheit and as warm as 75 degrees Fahrenheit but
85 unlike swordfish, they do not possess organs whose
chief function is to produce heat. Instead they retain the
heat they: generate swimming. Other bony fish quickly
Jose their heat to the sea, for their red muscle lies near
their skin, close to the cold water. In bluefin, who can
40 weigh as much as 1,000 pounds, red muscles are
housed deep within the body, near the backbone. Warm
venous blood flowing’ away from muscles heats cold
blood coming in through the arteries, enabling bluefin
to retain 98 percent of their body heat, giving them free
45 rein to forage in cold waters and to dip in and out of the
Gulf Stream, where sea temperatures plummet as much
as 27 degrees Fahrenheit across one nautical mile. In
cold water, the bluefin, separated from the chill by only
a taut skin, maintains an internal temperature of

50 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Coincident with the relocation of its red muscle,
bluefin developed the. unique style of swimming: for
which they are so aptly named (Thunnus thynnus, from
the Greek meaning to dart or lunge forward). While the

ACT-680

- 85 bodies of other.fish undulate through the water as they

swim, the crescent-shaped tail of the bluefin propels its

rigid body forward. Retractable fins, small scales, and

recessed eyes further enable bluefin fo thrust quickly

through thick and heavy seas, easily overcoming

60 water's drag and resistance. With their warm bodies,

rapid metabolism, and sleek design, bluefin excel at

both short sprints and long-distance travel, They. zoom

in on prey in short, quick bursts of speed, and they can

cruise at two body length’ ‘per second, easily making

65 long-distance endurance swims alorig an éntire ocean

basin. Engineers who design underwater robotics dream

~ of xeplicating the sleek. body of this 8-foot-long, 700-

pound fish who rushes without ceasing through the
breadth and depth of the sea.

70 Swordfish and bluefin travel throughout the
Atlantic with tremendous speed, but from moment to.
wnoment, day to day, month to month, their. migrations
are not well charted. In the winter of 1997, when the
warm Gulf Stream edged shoreward toward the coast of

75 Cape Hatteras, pressing against cold water rushing
south in the Labrador Current, giant bluefin gathered in
the warmth along the bousdary. The following year,
when the Gulf Stream moved offshore and the chilly
Labrador Current filled the waters of coastal Cape Hat-

80 teras, bluefin wintered in waters unknown to people.
Some bluefin, fatfened’ in, American coastal waters
‘during the summer and fall, follow the currents across
the sea during the. winter. How they navigate, no one
really knows, They could be guided by internal com~

85- passes of magnetite chips émbedded in theif skulls, by
the warmth, salinity, or motion of the current, by pat-
terns of polarized light received by the pineal window
in their heads, or by prey leaving their scent as an oily,
odorous slick in the water. :

31. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A, propose that research be conducted to confirm
which navigational method swordfish and bluefin.
actually use. .
persuade the reader. that swordfish are superior to
bluefin in their adaptation to ocean life.

C. speculate on the reasons why two fish have devel-
oped certain specialized traits. .

D. . describe two fishes” adaptations to the ocean envi-
ronment, including specialized traits and physical

.y features.

32. The author’s attitude regarding swordfish and bluefin
can best be described as one-of: :

_F. | appreciation for the advanced, unique abilities of
the two fish. .

G. concern that their adaptations put other fish at a
disadvantage.

H. confusion over how. their adaptations evolved so
quickly beyond other fish.

J. neutrality when comparing their abilities to those
of other fish.

The passage indicates ‘that thé body. temperature of a

cold-blooded fish is primarily determined by the:

A. limits of its geographic range.

B. speed at which it swims.

C. type of prey it consumes,

D. temperature of its surrounding water.

According to the passage, the most significant differ-.
ence between the temperature-regulation systems of-
swordfish and bluefin is that swordfish:

F. generate heat from a specialized organ, while
bluefin retain heat generated from swimming.

G. have a heat-producing organ located behind their
eyes, while the bluefin’s is near its backbone.

H. retain heat generated by mitochondria, while
bluefin retain heat generated by ocean currents.

J. retain most of the heat they generate, while bluefin
lose most of the heat they generate. .

It can reasonably be concluded from the passage that
the body of a bluefin remaining rigid while swimming
is related to the fact that its red muscles are:

A. moved sparingly in order to conserve body heat.
B. frozen stiff from the icy-cold water of the ocean.
C. restricted from movement by its super-tight skin.
D. located ‘deep within its body near the backbone.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that the. waters in and near the Gulf Stream pose a
challenge to most species of fish primarily. because
these waters:

F. are home to a large number and variety of predators.
G. represent a wide range of temperatures.

H. contain strong and swirling currents.

J. force fish into unfamiliar ocean regions.

According to the passage, the Greek-derived name for
bluefin refers to the:,

A. bluefin’s constant internal temperature.

B. powerful crescent-shaped tail of the bluefin:
C. bluefin’s lunging swimming style.

D. sound the bluefin produces while swimming.

The main purpose of the last paragraph is to:

¥, explain that charting the Gulf Stream would help
accurately predict the migration patterns of sword-
fish and bluefin,

G. highlight the fact that researchers do-not yet fully
understand the migrations of swordfish and
bluefin.

H. reiterate that the territory of swordfish and bluefin
is the entire Atlantic Ocean.

J. remind the reader of the speed and depth at which
swordfish and bluefin travel.

The passage supports the idea that all of the following
fish dwell in the Noith Sea and the Gulf of Mexico
year round EXCEPT:

A. cod.

B. haddock.

C. plaice.

‘D. bluefin.

According to the passage, the heat a swordfish gener-
ates is primarily intended to: :
FE. attract cold-blooded prey secking warmth.

G. maintain the warmth of its eyes and brain.

HL. increase its speed by keeping large muscles warm.
J. strengthen its long, sharp sword with warm blood.

_ G. soja (a wild soybean) produces tocopherol (a
type of vitaniin E). It then converts some. y- “tocopherol | into
o-tocopherol (another type of vitamin E). IG. soja, the
enzyme TMT catalyzes this reaction:

y-tocopherol MI. at tocopherol

A, thaliana (a mustard plant), produces y-tocopherol,

Six genetically identical lines of A. thaliana were >

developed (L1-L6). As shown in Table 1, L1-L4 were éach
exposed to a vector carrying 1 of the 4 cloned genes; LS
was exposed only to the vector; and L6 was left untreated.

Next, 10 plants from each line were grown. Table, 1
gives the tocopherol concentration and the percent (%) by
mass of the 2 types of tocopherol in the plants.

cellular damage than is. y-tocopherol, a scientist tried to
transfer G. saye *S TMT gene into A. thaliana:

Expériment L
. Four versions of G. soja’s TMT gene (TMTI-TMT4)

were cloned. Each gene was incorporated into a vector (a *

Four genetically different strains of A. thaliana were -

grown (S1-S4). S1-S4 were each exposed to a-vector car-.

The students used the following procedure to find R
for each test wire. They immersed the test wire in an oil
bath and allowed the test wire to come to the temperature
of the oil. Keeping the test wire in the oil bath (to control
the temperature of the test wire), they then closed the
switch and, using the rheostat (a variable resistor),
Adjusted the electrical current through the test wire until
the ammeter indicated 0.80-amp. As soon as the ammeter
indicated 0.80 amp, they measured the voltage, V, across
the test wire. Finally, they used V and the current
(0.80 amp) to calculate R. LO .

Passage V1

Four billion years.ago (4 BYA), the Sun was only 70%
‘as bright as it is today. With sunlight that faint, Earth’s
average surface temperature should have been ~15°C and
all surface water would have been frozen. However, iso-
tope evidence from certain sedimentary rocks (rocks made
of sediments deposited in liquid water) formed around that
time indicates that Earth’s surface temperature was. well
above freezing. .

Scientisis believe that 1 of 2 greenhouse gases, either
ammonia (NH;) or carbon dioxide (CO), was present in
Earth’s atmosphieré at a concentration well above that of
‘the respective gas. in the atmosphere today. This gas
trapped enough heat radiating from Earth’s surface to keep
the surface temperature above freezing.

Two scientists present their viewpoints.

Scientist I
Four BYA, large quantities of NH, continuously
entered Earth’s atmosphere from océan-floor hydrothermal
_ vents and by other processes. NH, is a more. efficient
greenhouse gas than is CO,, so a lower-concentration of
NH. is required to warm the atmospheré a given amount.
Any NH, molecule entering the atrhosphere would have
been broken down in 5-10 days by UV radiation. However,
methane (CH,), another gas that was abundant in the
atmosphere 4 BYA, combined with molecular nitrogen gas
to produce organic compounds that blocked much of the
incoming UV radiation and kept NH; molecules intact for
much longer than 10 days. Continuous removal of CO,
from the atmosphere by ocean water prevented CO, from
accumulating in'the atmosphere.

Scientist 2

Two carbon isotopes found in sedimentary rocks indi-
cate a 75% higher concéntration of CO, in Earth’s atmo-
sphere 4 BYA than the 360 parts per million (ppm) present
today. Pour BYA, large quantities of CO, continnously
entered the atmosphere through widespread, long-term vol-
cainic activity. Today, as in the past, much CO, .is removed
from the atmosphere as CO, becomes part of carbonates in
rock and sediment on land, However, 4 BYA, there was
80% less dry land area on which to form’ and store carbon-
ates, so CO, accumulated in the atmosphere.

. The vast amounts of CH, that would be required
to help preserve atmospheric NH, did not exist on
Earth 4 BYA. Thus, atmospheric NH, was too short-lived
to have been an effective greenhouse gas.

ACT-650,

CH, is also a greenhouse gas. Scientist 1 would most
likely agree that the presence of CH, in Harth’s atmo-
sphere 4 BYA: . .

A. helped warm Earth's surface. :

B. helped cool Harth’s surface.

C. reduced the quantity of NH, present.

D. increased the quantity of CO, present.

29,

30, A given conceniration-of NH, in Earth’s atmosphere
can trap as much heat radiating from Earth’s surface as
can a CO, concentration 3 times higher. Given this
information and Scientist 2’s viewpoint, the present-
day concentration of NH, that would trap an amount of
heat equivalent to that trapped by the present-day con-
centration of CO, would be approximately:

F. 50 ppm. ~

G.  80-ppm.

H. 120 ppm.

J. 360 ppm,

31. The Sun was 30% dimmer 4 BYA than it is today.
Assuming the relative proportions of all greenhouse
gases in Harth’s atmosphere have stayed constant, both
scientists would most likely agree that the minimum

to keep Earth’s surface temperature above freezing

D.

this information to support his/her viewpoint?

Students conducted experiments to study the effects of
temperature on density. :

In the experiments, each flask was filled to the top
with either distilled water or salt (NaCl) water at 20°C. A

rubber stopper with 2 holes-—one fitted witha thermometer -

and the other fitted with glass tubing—was placed in the
neck of the flask (see figure of apparatus), .

The initial height of the liquid in the tubing was adjusted to
25 mm above the top of the stopper.

Experiment i . ;

A flask filled with, distilled water was slowly heated.
As the temperature of the water increased, the height of the
water in the tubing increased. At 100°C, water and steam
squirted out the top of the tubing.

Experiment 2

The body of a flask filled with distilled water was
submerged in a cold bath at -6°C. As the temperature of
the water in the apparatus decreased, the height of the
water in the'tubing decreased. At 4°C, the height of the
water in the tubing stopped decreasing, and then began to
increase. At 0°C, water and ice were forced out the top of
the tubing. Eventually, the flask cracked in several places.

Experiment 3

Two.saltwater solutions were prepared. Solution I had
a lower salt concentration (in-g/mL) than did Solution IL.
‘Two flasks containing Solutions I and IL, respectively, were
slowly heated. In both flasks, the salt water in the tubing
rose and then squirted out the top of the tubing (at 102°C
for Solution I and at 104°C for Solution ED).

Two flasks contaisiing Solutions I and I, respectively,
were cooled as in Experiment 2. In both flasks, the height
of the salt water in the tubing decreased until the tempera-

ture reached -6°C and then remained level (no. freezing |

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any” *

responses, the total number of correct responses ylelds a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores, For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside colurnn of the table and circle the
scale scoré that corresponds to that raw score: As you deter-
mine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided on

- the right. The highest possible scale score for each test Is 36.
The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 4,

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. if the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest -whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fractiori that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank, This is your Composite score,
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest possi-
bie Composite score isl. .

While many cultures had their variations of the yo-yo,

the American version can be traced to the Philippines,

where yo-yos have been a national pastime for centuries.

In fact, the name yo-yo is a Tagalog g word that translates

as
ca

“come back.” In the 1920s Pedro Flores, a Filipino

immigrant, introduced the toy in the United States and

soon

36 .
started a yo-yo manufacturing company in California.

Flores’s design was different because the yo-yo’s string.

wasn’t tied 16 the axle of the toy, but rather looped around

it. This allowed a skilled handler to make the toy spin at _

the end of its string, or “sleep.”

(31

Yo-yo technology

really progressed substantially by making

Ed
a leap forward in the 1970s when designers added

weighted rims.so the toy would spin for a longer time.

In 1980, another innovation led to the development of ©

the “yo-yo with a brain,” which featured spring-loaded

mechanism that caused theyo-yo to return to its owner’s

‘The American craze for the toy began when the

38
entrepreneur Donald Duncan saw a demonstration of

Flores’s new yo-yo. Noticing the large crowd who

39
watched, Duncan quickly realized the yo-yo’s potential.

Flores sold his yo-yo company and all rights to Duncan

in 1932, after deciding that he was more interested in
teaching people how to handle yo-yos than he was

in manufacturing them. Duncan immediately launched
an elaborate national advertising campaign to promote
the toy. He also sent Duncan Yo-Yo. Professionals

around the country, demonstrating tr tricks and.sponsoring

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel
Toning the Sweep by Angela Johnson (©1993 by Angela
Johnson}. .

‘
The narrator is visiting her grandmother, Ola, to help her pre-
pare to move. Martha is Ola’s friend and neighbor.

I think about how everybody Ola khows here has a
story: Daddy says that everybody has one and their sto-
ries are all a part of us. If Ola loves these people, then
they must be a-part of me too. It must be true about all
of us being a.part of one another like Daddy says.

a

Ola hums on the porch while Mama eats an apple
and labels boxes. I go over to the phone by the refriger-
ator and-call Martha. When she picks up, her voice

rings out and is so familiar. I tell her Olas 3 idea about: |

10 making a movie.

Martha Jackson's hair is the color of coal and she
must be about my grandmama’s age. She cuts her hair
short, and sometimes it sticks straight’up, but she
doesn’t care.

15 She’s probably one of the tallest people 1 know,
and walks like she’s swimming. Martha looks. at you for
a long time before she decides to speak.

She’s leaning.on a Joshua tree in Ola’s front yard,
saying, “It’s like poetry and eating to me now. You let _
20 the camera become part of you. Like your head and
your eyes. If the camera were to fall out of your hands,
it should be like your head falling off in the middle of a
* conversation.” .

“I don’t know if the camera can ever be that spe-

268 cial to me, Martha,” I say. “I just got used to the camera

my dad gave me four years 280. T can remember to take
off the lens cap sometimes.” :

Martha smiles. “This is a thing to get used to— :
that’s all, No magic, no special real training. Turn the
30 camera on and shoot.”

I take the. camera and start taping a crow that’s

landed on the back porch. I figure it’s a start, The crow,
gets real interested in me filming him and stops pecking”

at the old apple core he’s found near the’ garbage cans.
He hops off the-porch and checks me and the cainera
out till he sees something else off over by some brush.

Martha’s watching me. with a smirk when I turn
back to her with the camera. “I.guess you'll do okay by
yourself now.” She looks at me for-a long time, then
says, “Let’s talk about Ola.”

I start shooting and say to myself, “A part of me,”
and hope that the thing is going afd the Jens cap hasn’t
been.on the whole time I’ve been taping the crow. I
zoom in on Martha leaning against the Joshua tree. She
stares into the camera,

“[ met Ola in the late’ summer of 1964 “cause there
was no other way around it.”

A pot falls in the kitchen, and we can hear Ola
Jaughing—then she stops: I keep the camera running.

“Like I was saying,” Martha starts to whisper, but
changes her mind and speaks even louder. “I couldn't
help’ but meet her. There’s about five hundred people
that live out here, and she happens to be my closest
neighbor. She was playing her-music loud one night,
and I was sitting out in my yard.”

‘Ola comes out the screen door and sits down by:
Martha Jackson. Two people couldn’t be more different
in looks, [have them both in the frame.

Ola’s short and delicate—like she'd break if you
held her arm too tight. She wouldn’t break, though. She
hands Martha a glass of iced tea and sits cross-legged.
on the ground.

E press the pause button, then change my mind. I
sit down on a Jawn chair and ask, “What did you two
think of each other when you first met?” It’s easier to
ask what I’d usually think of as a nosy question from.
behind a camera. . :

Martha whispers, “I thought she had the worst
accent of anybody that I’d ever heard. It grew on me,
though, and I got used to it. L liked her.car and the. way
the fool painted the house yellow the day after shé and
Diane moved i in.” .

Ola spills'a little iced tea and says, “No, you

didn’t. You yelled from the road that this shade of

75 yellow didn’t look good from where you stood, and

what was it called?” Ola looks at the camera and tells
me, “Your mama was $0 embarrassed, Emmic, she
begged me to stop painting it yellow and just make it
gray or something. Your mama always took things’ so
much to heart.” .

“What did you say to Martha then?”

*] told her I didn’t know who she was, but if she

. had enough energy to yell from the road at a perfect

stranger, she probably had enough strength to pick up a
brush.”

Martha tilts her head back and laughs. “So I did.”

Ola, gets up and goes into the house without
making a sound. I don’t think that Martha even knows
she’s gone, ’cause her eyes are closed.

I want to make this movie on my own. Martha
makes me want to know all of Ola’s friends. I’ want to
know who they are and what they’ve done, I°ll put them
all in front of the camera, and when the movie’s done, it
can be my gift to Ola. The other gifts I’ve given her are
things she could put on the wall or wear. I figure ‘this
will be better than all that. I'll give her memories of her
people.

. Based on the passage, Ola and Martha can reasonably
be said to share all of the following traits EXCEPT a:

A. sense of humor.

needed Martha’s encouragement to continue.

H., Ola proposed the idea to Martha, who recruited the
narrator to make the movie.

J. The narrator suggested the ‘idea to Ola, who had to
be talked into it by Martha.

. The narrator’s two references to a camera’s lens cap
(lines 27 and'42) primarily serve to suggest her:
'

A. expanding knowledge of camera terminology.

B. continuing desire to uncover her artistic vision.
C. ongoing insecurity about her skill with a camera.
D. growing eagerness to use a camera to tell stories.

4. Viewed in the context of the passage, Martha’s smirk
(line 37) most likely reflects a feeling of:,

F.. mild weariness.

G. sharp condescension.
H. profound relief.

Jj. slight amusement.

5. As presented by the participants; the initial meeting
between Ola and Martha can best be described as:

A. a misunderstanding that escalates into harsh words
until the two agree to keep their distance’ from
each. other. . .

B. a potentially bitter confrontation that, becatse of
the personalities of the two people, turns into a

.€. Ola shares a close bond with her neighbors.

D. people everywhere are connected to each other by
stories and love.

10. The narrator’s statement “She wouldn’t break, though”

. stronger than she appears to be. :

more active than many people half her age.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage Is adapted. from the articie
“The Trouble with Fries” by Malcoim Gladweli (©2001 by’ The
Condé Nast Publications Inc.).

It is entirely possible, right now, to make a deli-
cious French fry that does not carry with it a death sen-
tence. A French fry can be much 1 more than a delivery
vehicle for fat.

Is it really that simple, though? Consider the cau-

tionary tale of the-efforts of a group of food scientists at
Auburn University more than a decade ago to come up
with a better hamburger. The Auburn team wanted to
create a leaner beef that tasted as good as regular
ground beef, They couldn’t just remove the fat, because
that would leave the meat dry and mealy. They wanted
to replace the fat. The goal of the Auburn scientists was
to cut about two-thirds of the fat from‘normal ground

-beéf, which meant that they needed to find something

to add to the beef that would hold an equivalent amount
of water—and continue to retain that water even as the

beef was being grilled. Their choice? Seaweed, or,

more precisely, carrageenan. They also selected’ some
basic flavor enhancers, desigtied to make up for the lost
fat “taste.” The result was a beef patty that was roughly
three-quarters water, twenty per cent.protein, five per
cent or so fat, and a quarter of a per cent seaweed. They
called it AU Lean.

It didn’t take the Auburn scientists long to realize
that they had created something special. They began
doing blind taste comparisons of AU Lean burgers and
traditional twenty-per-cent-fat burgers. Time after time,

the AU Lean burgers won. Next, they took their inven- |

tion into the field: They. récruited a hundred families
and supplied them with three kinds of ground beef for
home cooking over consecutive three-week intervals—
regular “market” ground beef with twenty per cent fat,
ground beef. with five per cent fat, and AU Lean. The
families were asked to rate the different kinds of beef,
without knowing which was which. Again, the :AU
Lean won hands down.

What the Auburn team showed was. that, even
though people love the taste and feel of fat—and natu-
rally gravitate toward high-fat food—they can. be
fooled into thinking there is a lot of fat in something
when there isn’t. When the group tried to lower the fat
in AU Lean below five per cent, people didn’t like it
anymore. But, within the relatively broad range of
between five and twenty-five per cent, you can add
water and some flavoring and most people can’t tell the
difference.

What's more, people appear.to. be more sensitive
to the volume of food they consume than to its calorie
content. Barbara Rolls, a nutritionist at Penn State, has
demonstrated this principle with satiety studies. She
feeds one group of people a high-volume snack and
another group a. low-volume snack. Even though the
two snacks have the same calorie count, she finds that

ACT-650

55

70

7

80

‘90

ik

people who eat the high-volume snack feel more satis-
fied. Eating AU Lean, in short, isn’t going to leave you
with a craving for more calories; you'll feel just'as full.

For anyone looking to improve the quality of fast
food, all this is heartening news. It means that you
should be able to put low-fat cheese and low-fat.may-
onnaise in a fast-food: hamburger without anyone’s
complaining. It also means that there’s no particular
reason to use twenty-per-cent-fat ground beet i in a fast-
food burger, In 1990, using just this argument, the
‘Auburn team suggested to McDonald’s that it make a
hamburger out of AU Lean. Shortly thereafter, McDon-
ald’s came out with the McLean. Deluxe. Other fast-
food houses scrambled to, follow suit, Nutritionists
were delighted. And fast food appeared on the verge of
arevolution.

‘Only, it wasn’t. The McLean was a flop, and four
years later it was off the market. What happened? Part
of the problem appears to have been that McDonald’s
rushed the burger to market before many of the produc-
tion kinks had been worked. out. Mote important,
though, was the psychological handicap the burger
faced."People liked AU Lean in blind taste tests because
they didn't know it was AU Lean; they were fooled into
thinking it was regular ground beef. But nobody was
fooled when it came to the McLean Deluxe. It was sold
as the healthy choice--and who goes to McDonald's for
health food? .

This is sobering news for those interested in
improving the American diet. For years; the nutrition
movement in this country has made transparency one of
its principal goals: it has assumed that the bést way to
help people improve their diets is to tell them precisely
what’s in their food, to label certain foods good and
certain foods bad. But transparency can’ backfire,
because sometimes nothing is more deadly for our taste
buds than the knowledge that what we are eating is
good for us.

The author most nearly portrays the Auburn scientists
as: .

A. severe critics of the fast-food industry’s practices.

B.. enthusiastic promoters of their promising work.

C. diligent researchers uninterested in the practical
application of their work.

D. clever innovators more interested in nutrition than
in how food tastes.

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted, from The Piano Shop _

on the Left Bank by Thad Carhart (©2001 by Thad Carhart).

No one knows exactly when the: piano was

.. invented. The gerierally accepted date is around 1700.
There is little doubt, however, about its inventor, an
instrument maker in Florence, Italy, named Bartolomeo
Cristofori, who developed -a way of making a struck
string resound loudly. Before Cristofori, keyboard
instruments were unsatisfactory for different reasons:
clavichords, whose sttings are struck, were small and
delicate, and their greatly reduced volume made them
10 suitable only for small gatherings. Harpsichords, while
“larger and therefore considerably louder, had one over-
riding limitation: since the string is plucked, the force
with. which the key is depressed is unrelated to the

a

volume of the sotind produced. Dynamic control’ of

15 each note was not possible.

What was needed—and what Cristofori invented-—
was an instrument as large and robust as the big harpsi-
chords that would also allow the dynamic-range that
before had only been available on the flimsy clavi-
chords. The first piano was described by a contempo-
gary musician in 1711 as a “gravicembalo col piano e
forte,” a “harpsichord with soft and loud.” This was the
essential breakthrough, but it took decades for the seed
to find fertile ground, and it did s6.not in Italy but in
' 28, eighteenth-century Germany.

2

Ss

German instrament - makers incorporated
Cristofori’s breakthrough into a series of increasingly
powerful keyboard instruments that were true pianos.
Johann Sebastian Bach was inipressed by the first piano

* 80 he tried, but he pointed out limitations that still needed
to be worked on: a heavy action and a treble that was
not loud enough. Two of his sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel
and Johatin Christian, championed the instrument in the

, hext generation; by the time Johann Christian Bach

35 gave England's first solo piano performance in 1768,

the triumph of this. new keyboard instrument over the
harpsichord was assured,

The role of the keyboard as a solo instrument came

to the fore musically. It was'no longer just another part

40 of the ensemble, and its unique volume freed it from
the confines of the drawing room to which the harpsi-

chord had almost always been consigned. Haydn and.

Mozart both wrote masterful sonatas for the new instru-
ment, its keyboard was’ greatly expanded, and its

45 dynamic range-—the single feature that most distin-
guished it from the harpsichord—was exploited fully. A
whole new technique stressing fluidity was: developed
for the piano, and. Mozart wrote: “It should flow like
oil.” Solo. concerts became the norin rather than the

50 exception, and a class of instrumentalists with tech:
ique and power arrived on the scene.

What had been a tinkerer’s offshoot among harpsi-
chord makers became an industry in its own right.
London'and Vienna were its focal points. The two capi-

55 tals gave rise to distinct schools of piano building, the

principal difference having to do with how the action—
the intricate mechanism that, activates the hammers to
strike the strings—was conceived and assembled. Vien-
nese pianos were generally softer, with- a: refined
singing tone that allowed the melody to come to the
. fore; the piarios themselves had delicate cabinetry. Eng-
lish pianos, on the other hand, had-a more robust tone,
with a stronger ‘action and greater tension in the strings; *
they had solid cases and sturdy frames, The great Vien-
65 nese composers of the classical era—Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven—played Viennese pianos, but the transition
to the stronger instriments of the English school can be
seen in Beethoven’s last piano sonatas.

: Beethoven was-known for the increasing dynamic
70 contrasts in’ his works for piano, from whisper to thun-.
der, and he sometimes destroyed the fragile Viennese .
pianos when playing his music. He had a sttong influ-
ence on the direction of piano manufacture, and as early
as 1796 he expressed his frustration with the overly
delicate styles of Playing that were a holdover from
harpsichords. . . ,

G

In. 1818, Broadwood, the pre-eminent English
mantfacturer of the day, offered him a grand piano that -
incorporated all of the Jatest features: stronger case and

80 frame, trichord stringing, more responsive action. This
piano, too, Beethoven damdged with the fervor of. his
playing (a contemporary reported that “the brokea
strings were jumbled up like a thorn bush.in a storm”), -
but he remained attached to it until his death in 1827.

85 He imagined music unlike ariything his contemporaries
wete writing; the Hammerklavier sonata from this
period still strikes many as a revelation of the piano’s
extreme limits of power and expressiveness.

NATURAL SCIENCE; This, passage is adapted from Great
Waters: An Atlantic Passage by Deborah Cramer (©2001 by
Deborah Cramer).

Relative newcomers to the marine world, bluefin +

tuna and swordfish have evolved into some of the sea’s
most highly developed fishes. While the cod, haddock,
flounder, and plaice who dwell year-round in the North
Sea.and the Gulf of Mexico are cold-blooded, their
body temperatures rising and falling in synchrony with
‘the ‘surrounding water, thus limiting their geographic
range, swofdfish and bluefin, exquisitely adapted to
live in the vastness of the sea, are free from the bound-
40 aries imposed by temperature, The swordfish who sur-
‘face at the. shelf edge havé swum up from the depths,
rising hundreds of feet through the water each evening
ag the sun sets, following their prey of fish and squid. A
temperature difference of 36 degrees Fahrenheit, as
16 great as the swing between winter and summer, night
and. day, separates cold deep from warm surface.
Swordfish exit one realm and swim into the other in
under an hour,

a

Moving between such extremes would stun the

_ 20: nervous system of a cold-blooded fish, but these ocean
princes make their own heat, warming themselves in

the deep cold. The burner of the swordfish lies behind

its eyes, below its brain, a dark mass of tissue sur-

rounded by insulating fat, heavy with blood, and loaded .

26 with energy-producing mitochondria. With warm brain
and eyes, swordfish can chase their food in waters deep
and shallow, near and distant. By night, they feed at the

surface, at the edge of the deep water. By day, they .

move onto shallow banks, like Georges or the Grand
Banks, and dive down-to feed, slashing through schools
of menhaden and mackerel with their long, sharp
swords. . .

Ks

Bluefin tuna thrive in waters as cold as 40 ‘degrees
Fahrenheit and as warm as 75 degrees Fahrenheit but
85 unlike swordfish, they do not possess organs whose
chief function is to produce heat. Instead they retain the
heat they: generate swimming. Other bony fish quickly
Jose their heat to the sea, for their red muscle lies near
their skin, close to the cold water. In bluefin, who can
40 weigh as much as 1,000 pounds, red muscles are
housed deep within the body, near the backbone. Warm
venous blood flowing’ away from muscles heats cold
blood coming in through the arteries, enabling bluefin
to retain 98 percent of their body heat, giving them free
45 rein to forage in cold waters and to dip in and out of the
Gulf Stream, where sea temperatures plummet as much
as 27 degrees Fahrenheit across one nautical mile. In
cold water, the bluefin, separated from the chill by only
a taut skin, maintains an internal temperature of

50 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Coincident with the relocation of its red muscle,
bluefin developed the. unique style of swimming: for
which they are so aptly named (Thunnus thynnus, from
the Greek meaning to dart or lunge forward). While the

ACT-680

- 85 bodies of other.fish undulate through the water as they

swim, the crescent-shaped tail of the bluefin propels its

rigid body forward. Retractable fins, small scales, and

recessed eyes further enable bluefin fo thrust quickly

through thick and heavy seas, easily overcoming

60 water's drag and resistance. With their warm bodies,

rapid metabolism, and sleek design, bluefin excel at

both short sprints and long-distance travel, They. zoom

in on prey in short, quick bursts of speed, and they can

cruise at two body length’ ‘per second, easily making

65 long-distance endurance swims alorig an éntire ocean

basin. Engineers who design underwater robotics dream

~ of xeplicating the sleek. body of this 8-foot-long, 700-

pound fish who rushes without ceasing through the
breadth and depth of the sea.

70 Swordfish and bluefin travel throughout the
Atlantic with tremendous speed, but from moment to.
wnoment, day to day, month to month, their. migrations
are not well charted. In the winter of 1997, when the
warm Gulf Stream edged shoreward toward the coast of

75 Cape Hatteras, pressing against cold water rushing
south in the Labrador Current, giant bluefin gathered in
the warmth along the bousdary. The following year,
when the Gulf Stream moved offshore and the chilly
Labrador Current filled the waters of coastal Cape Hat-

80 teras, bluefin wintered in waters unknown to people.
Some bluefin, fatfened’ in, American coastal waters
‘during the summer and fall, follow the currents across
the sea during the. winter. How they navigate, no one
really knows, They could be guided by internal com~

85- passes of magnetite chips émbedded in theif skulls, by
the warmth, salinity, or motion of the current, by pat-
terns of polarized light received by the pineal window
in their heads, or by prey leaving their scent as an oily,
odorous slick in the water. :

31. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A, propose that research be conducted to confirm
which navigational method swordfish and bluefin.
actually use. .
persuade the reader. that swordfish are superior to
bluefin in their adaptation to ocean life.

C. speculate on the reasons why two fish have devel-
oped certain specialized traits. .

D. . describe two fishes” adaptations to the ocean envi-
ronment, including specialized traits and physical

.y features.

32. The author’s attitude regarding swordfish and bluefin
can best be described as one-of: :

_F. | appreciation for the advanced, unique abilities of
the two fish. .

G. concern that their adaptations put other fish at a
disadvantage.

H. confusion over how. their adaptations evolved so
quickly beyond other fish.

J. neutrality when comparing their abilities to those
of other fish.

The passage indicates ‘that thé body. temperature of a

cold-blooded fish is primarily determined by the:

A. limits of its geographic range.

B. speed at which it swims.

C. type of prey it consumes,

D. temperature of its surrounding water.

According to the passage, the most significant differ-.
ence between the temperature-regulation systems of-
swordfish and bluefin is that swordfish:

F. generate heat from a specialized organ, while
bluefin retain heat generated from swimming.

G. have a heat-producing organ located behind their
eyes, while the bluefin’s is near its backbone.

H. retain heat generated by mitochondria, while
bluefin retain heat generated by ocean currents.

J. retain most of the heat they generate, while bluefin
lose most of the heat they generate. .

It can reasonably be concluded from the passage that
the body of a bluefin remaining rigid while swimming
is related to the fact that its red muscles are:

A. moved sparingly in order to conserve body heat.
B. frozen stiff from the icy-cold water of the ocean.
C. restricted from movement by its super-tight skin.
D. located ‘deep within its body near the backbone.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that the. waters in and near the Gulf Stream pose a
challenge to most species of fish primarily. because
these waters:

F. are home to a large number and variety of predators.
G. represent a wide range of temperatures.

H. contain strong and swirling currents.

J. force fish into unfamiliar ocean regions.

According to the passage, the Greek-derived name for
bluefin refers to the:,

A. bluefin’s constant internal temperature.

B. powerful crescent-shaped tail of the bluefin:
C. bluefin’s lunging swimming style.

D. sound the bluefin produces while swimming.

The main purpose of the last paragraph is to:

¥, explain that charting the Gulf Stream would help
accurately predict the migration patterns of sword-
fish and bluefin,

G. highlight the fact that researchers do-not yet fully
understand the migrations of swordfish and
bluefin.

H. reiterate that the territory of swordfish and bluefin
is the entire Atlantic Ocean.

J. remind the reader of the speed and depth at which
swordfish and bluefin travel.

The passage supports the idea that all of the following
fish dwell in the Noith Sea and the Gulf of Mexico
year round EXCEPT:

A. cod.

B. haddock.

C. plaice.

‘D. bluefin.

According to the passage, the heat a swordfish gener-
ates is primarily intended to: :
FE. attract cold-blooded prey secking warmth.

G. maintain the warmth of its eyes and brain.

HL. increase its speed by keeping large muscles warm.
J. strengthen its long, sharp sword with warm blood.

Passage V1

Four billion years.ago (4 BYA), the Sun was only 70%
‘as bright as it is today. With sunlight that faint, Earth’s
average surface temperature should have been ~15°C and
all surface water would have been frozen. However, iso-
tope evidence from certain sedimentary rocks (rocks made
of sediments deposited in liquid water) formed around that
time indicates that Earth’s surface temperature was. well
above freezing. .

Scientisis believe that 1 of 2 greenhouse gases, either
ammonia (NH;) or carbon dioxide (CO), was present in
Earth’s atmosphieré at a concentration well above that of
‘the respective gas. in the atmosphere today. This gas
trapped enough heat radiating from Earth’s surface to keep
the surface temperature above freezing.

Two scientists present their viewpoints.

Scientist I
Four BYA, large quantities of NH, continuously
entered Earth’s atmosphere from océan-floor hydrothermal
_ vents and by other processes. NH, is a more. efficient
greenhouse gas than is CO,, so a lower-concentration of
NH. is required to warm the atmospheré a given amount.
Any NH, molecule entering the atrhosphere would have
been broken down in 5-10 days by UV radiation. However,
methane (CH,), another gas that was abundant in the
atmosphere 4 BYA, combined with molecular nitrogen gas
to produce organic compounds that blocked much of the
incoming UV radiation and kept NH; molecules intact for
much longer than 10 days. Continuous removal of CO,
from the atmosphere by ocean water prevented CO, from
accumulating in'the atmosphere.

Scientist 2

Two carbon isotopes found in sedimentary rocks indi-
cate a 75% higher concéntration of CO, in Earth’s atmo-
sphere 4 BYA than the 360 parts per million (ppm) present
today. Pour BYA, large quantities of CO, continnously
entered the atmosphere through widespread, long-term vol-
cainic activity. Today, as in the past, much CO, .is removed
from the atmosphere as CO, becomes part of carbonates in
rock and sediment on land, However, 4 BYA, there was
80% less dry land area on which to form’ and store carbon-
ates, so CO, accumulated in the atmosphere.

. The vast amounts of CH, that would be required
to help preserve atmospheric NH, did not exist on
Earth 4 BYA. Thus, atmospheric NH, was too short-lived
to have been an effective greenhouse gas.

ACT-650,

with Scientist 2’s description of how CO; enters and is
removed from Earth’s atmosphere? . .

CH, is also a greenhouse gas. Scientist 1 would most
likely agree that the presence of CH, in Harth’s atmo-
sphere 4 BYA: . .

A. helped warm Earth's surface. :

B. helped cool Harth’s surface.

C. reduced the quantity of NH, present.

D. increased the quantity of CO, present.

29,

30, A given conceniration-of NH, in Earth’s atmosphere
can trap as much heat radiating from Earth’s surface as
can a CO, concentration 3 times higher. Given this
information and Scientist 2’s viewpoint, the present-
day concentration of NH, that would trap an amount of
heat equivalent to that trapped by the present-day con-
centration of CO, would be approximately:

F. 50 ppm. ~

G.  80-ppm.

H. 120 ppm.

J. 360 ppm,

Students conducted experiments to study the effects of
temperature on density. :

In the experiments, each flask was filled to the top
with either distilled water or salt (NaCl) water at 20°C. A

rubber stopper with 2 holes-—one fitted witha thermometer -

and the other fitted with glass tubing—was placed in the
neck of the flask (see figure of apparatus), .

The initial height of the liquid in the tubing was adjusted to
25 mm above the top of the stopper.

Experiment i . ;

A flask filled with, distilled water was slowly heated.
As the temperature of the water increased, the height of the
water in the tubing increased. At 100°C, water and steam
squirted out the top of the tubing.

Experiment 2

The body of a flask filled with distilled water was
submerged in a cold bath at -6°C. As the temperature of
the water in the apparatus decreased, the height of the
water in the'tubing decreased. At 4°C, the height of the
water in the tubing stopped decreasing, and then began to
increase. At 0°C, water and ice were forced out the top of
the tubing. Eventually, the flask cracked in several places.

Experiment 3

Two.saltwater solutions were prepared. Solution I had
a lower salt concentration (in-g/mL) than did Solution IL.
‘Two flasks containing Solutions I and IL, respectively, were
slowly heated. In both flasks, the salt water in the tubing
rose and then squirted out the top of the tubing (at 102°C
for Solution I and at 104°C for Solution ED).

Two flasks contaisiing Solutions I and I, respectively,
were cooled as in Experiment 2. In both flasks, the height
of the salt water in the tubing decreased until the tempera-

ture reached -6°C and then remained level (no. freezing |

occurred). .

35. Water in the upper part of a hypothetical 2-compartment
container is at 10°C, and water in the lower part is at

water at 10°C

water at 80°C

If the barrier separating the 2 compartments could be
" removed without disturbing the water, what mixing, if
any, would occur?

A. No mixing would ‘occur, bécause the water in the
upper part of the container is more dense than the
water in the lower part of the container.

B. No mixing would occur, because the water in the
upper part of the container is less dense than the

. water in the lower part of the container.

C. Mixing would occur, because the water in the
lower part of the container is more dense than the
water in the upper part of the container,

D. Mixing would occur, because the water in the
lower part of the container is less dense than the
water in the upper part of the container.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any” *

responses, the total number of correct responses ylelds a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores, For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside colurnn of the table and circle the
scale scoré that corresponds to that raw score: As you deter-
mine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided on

- the right. The highest possible scale score for each test Is 36.
The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 4,

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. if the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest -whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fractiori that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank, This is your Composite score,
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest possi-
bie Composite score isl. .
