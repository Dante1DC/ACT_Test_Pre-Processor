This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics,
reading, and science. These tests measure skills and
abilities highly related to high school course work and
success in college. Calculators may be used on the
mathematics test only.

The questions in each test are numbered, and the
suggested answers for each question are lettered. On
the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered
to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are
lettered to correspond to the suggested answers.

For each question, first decide which answer is best.
Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals
numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the
oval in that row lettered the same as your answer.
Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil
and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink
or a mechanical pencil.

Mark only one answer to each question. If you change
your mind about an answer, erase your first mark
thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each
question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals
with the same number as the question.

Only responses marked on your answer document
will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only
on the number of questions you answer correctly during
the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized
for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every
question even if you must guess.

You may work on each test only when the testing
staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is
called for that test, you should use the time remaining to
reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test.
You may not look back to a test on which time has
already been called, and you may not go ahead to
another test. To do so will disqualify you from the
examination.

Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called
at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill
in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test.
To do so will disqualify you from the examination.

Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet.

DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET
UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

ENGLISH TEST
45 Minutes—75 Questions

DIRECTIONS: In the five passages that follow, certain
words and phrases are underlined and numbered. In
the right-hand column, you will find alternatives for the
underlined part. In most cases, you are to choose the
one that best expresses the idea, makes the statement
appropriate for standard written English, or is worded
most consistently with the style and tone of the passage
as a whole. If you think the original version is best,
choose “NO CHANGE.” In some cases, you will find in
the right-hand column a question about the underlined
part. You are to choose the best answer to the question.

You will also find questions about a section of the pas-
sage, or about the passage as a whole. These questions
do not refer to an underlined portion of the passage, but
rather are identified by a number or numbers in a box.

For each question, choose the alternative you consider
best and fill in the corresponding oval on your answer
document. Read each passage through once before you
begin to answer the questions that accompany it. For
many of the questions, you must read several sentences
beyond the question to determine the answer. Be sure
that you have read far enough ahead each time you
choose an alternative.

Celebrating Powwows
Pauwau is an Algonquin word that once

referred to medicine men, who danced, during

T _
tribal ceremonies. However, Europeans
whom witnessed these ceremonies for the first

2

time thought the word referred to the whole event
and began calling the events “powwows,” the term

3
now used by most American Indians. These early

ceremonies were held, by individual tribes to cure
4

disease or to ensure success in battle or hunting.
A
At modern-day powwows, people gather to dance,
sing, socialize, and witness ceremonies honoring
the achievements of individuals or groups.
At most modern powwows, the main focus is

dance. Attendees can be apart of the competitive

G
dances or the open social dances called intertribals.

The participants danced to the music of drums.

7
Each group of people who sit around a large skin

drum, singing and playing the drum in unison, is
A

known as a “Drum.” These Drums provide the music

for each powwow activities. While smaller powwows
o)

may host only one Drum, larger powwows (which
10
can last for days) usually involve several Drums.
10
Many American Indians mark important events

of their lives at powwows. At a recent powwow
at Stanford University, one family paid tribute to
their son, who was soon to graduate from law school.
A special dance was announced, and the crowd
grew quiet. The young man’s father stepped up to
the microphone and began describing his son’s many
achievements. When he was finished, a Drum began
to sing and play. Some of the young man’s family
members began to dance in a circle. Before that,
people came from out of the crowd to shake hands
with the young man and dance with his family. In
this way, his achievements were honored by the
entire community.

Today, American Indians attend powwows
due to the fact that they want to celebrate their culture

2
as well as the achievements of their family members.

Powwows provide and afford a chance to mark
B
important transitions, to visit with old friends and

meet new ones, dance and singing take place, and to
ry
celebrate the future as well as the past.

Question 15 asks about the preceding passage
as a whole.

15.

. Suppose the writer had intended to write a brief essay

on an American Indian tradition that has been modified
and continues to the present day. Would this essay suc-
cessfully fulfill the writer’s goal?

A. Yes, because the essay describes tribal ceremonies
that predated the arrival of Europeans and the
powwows that are a modern adaptation of those
ceremonies.

B. Yes, because the essay explains in considerable
detail the concept of the Drum and its central role
in present-day powwows.

C. No, because the essay states that the powwows
that exist today serve entirely different purposes
from those of the earlier tribal ceremonies.

D. No, because the essay points out that the word
powwow originally referred to medicine men and
then doesn’t indicate whether their role still exists
today.

PASSAGE II
Edward O. Wilson’s Ants
Careful of where he steps, carrying tweezers,
vials notebooks and pencils, Edward O. Wilson has

16
looked over, under, and into the world of ants. He

has discovered that the influence of ants’ behavior
i
on their success as a species is as great as their

number is vast. By thinking about and contemplating

18
ants, which are among the planet’s smaller creatures,

Wilson has arrived at significant conclusions about
their social organization and survival.

[1] Wilson studies patterns of organization and

behavior in whole ant colonies. | 19 | [2] Because ants

resume normal behavior quickly, ant colonies are
easy to maintain and study in a laboratory. [3] By
observing ants in a few colonies in the field and in

the lab, Wilson can describe an entire species.

[4] He designs his studies with two questions in
the notebooks of his mind. [5] First, how do colony

20
members differentiate and divide labor? [6] And

second, why has some combinations of these
divisions of labor more successful than others?

[7] Wilson has found that worker ants are at the
center of a colonies success. [8] They integrate the
colony and provide labor specialization. [9] Some
worker ants dedicate their lives to feeding the colony,

foraging for and retrieving fifteen to twenty times

their weight in food daily. | 23 | [10] Additionally,

some foraging ants work in pairs. [11] In another

The writer is considering adding the following to the
end of the preceding sentence (placing a comma after
the word daily):

usually bits of human food debris.
Should the writer make this addition here?

A. Yes, because it adds an important detail that helps
answer Wilson’s questions.

B. Yes, because it shows how hard ants are able to
work.

C. No, because it distracts from the focus on the spe-
cialization of the ant population.

Wilson identifies this selfless behavior among worker
27
ants as altruism. Dedication to the benefit of the colony

is, in his view the single most important feature of ant
social behavior. In his observations, Wilson has seen
ants alter colony populations by adjusting their
foraging and feeding patterns, exemplifying their

zeal to survive. Ant societies can be fragmented and

divided, Wilson has discovered, but their devotion
»

to their queen and colony ensures that ants are cool.

It is this ritual tea that has taught me to take pleasure

Question 45 asks about the preceding passage
as a whole.

45. The writer is considering inserting the following sen-

steps.

A. provide an effective transition and serve to distin-
guish one part of the ritual from the others.

B. reinforce the idea that the writer’s solitary
microwave tea is a special ritual.

C. introduce the idea that there is more than one part

PASSAGE IV
Everyday People
Rita Dove’s poems are sometimes described as
intimate. They are identified as such because they
focus on people involved in the pure and simple act
of being human. An African American writer, Dove
tackles stuff that crosses and undermines racial

a
boundaries. Her vision includes ordinary people from

diverse walks of life as she explores the depth of their
reactions to the world. An example of this perception
is her poetry collection Thomas and Beulah, for
which she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987.

Seventy-nine pages long, Thomas and Beulah

is loosely based on the lives of Dove’s maternal

grandparents. | 49 | Their story is neither tragic nor

dramatic, but it does portray people who Dove states
0
have been “ignored and lost.” Although the characters,

Thomas and Beulah, live together for decades; the

Divided into two sections, consisting of
8
twenty-three and twenty-one poems, respectively,
33
the volume opens with an explanation from Dove

that the poems “tell two sides of a story and are

meant to be read in sequence.” In telling this story,

the skillful revelation of lives are disjoined by a lack
=

of understanding or shared perspectives. For example,

5
while Beulah is pregnant with their third daughter,

Thomas plans what he will teach a son. Although
Thomas certainly loves his daughters, his longing for
a son whom he can teach to be a man, according to
his conception of what it means to be a man, is
evident. Beulah’s life, on the other hand, is centered

36
around her daughters.

Dove conveys the sadness in Thomas and Beulah’s

relationship, but she helps ourselves to accept their
7

marital differences by depicting the grace and goodness

of their individual lives. In Thomas and Beulah, Dove
demonstrates her ability to highlight the vitality and
insight that reside in her otherwise unremarkable

characters. At it’s heart, Thomas and Beulah offers
38

us a testament to the human spirit.

No, because although the writer expresses enthusi-
asm for composting, the essay does not focus on
comparing this activity to other hobbies.

LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
title story of the collection Hunger by Lan Samantha Chang
(©1998 by Lan Samantha Chang).

I often dream about the restaurant where I first
met Tian. Late at night, the memory flickers up before
me, dim and silent, never changing. I see the simple
neon sign that reads “Vermilion Palace.” The drifting
snow blows up against the scarlet double doors. I see
myself walking toward those doors—a slight, brown
girl with hair like an inkbrush, tilted eyes, and a wary
mouth.

For my first few months in New York City, I
could not stay warm. I wore a heavy coat and wound
myself in woolen scarves, but the chill went deep
beneath my skin, and the winter wind found every
crevice as I walked to the restaurant on numb feet, past
the subway stop, the university, and the music school,
my gaze fixed on the icy pavement to keep myself from
falling. I could not taste my food or feel the softness of
my narrow bed. I had been in the city for two months
before I even noticed the music school. And then one
evening I heard a student practicing. Walking past a
basement window, I caught the thread of a violin
melody, high and sweet. The sound rose up through a
crack in the window and between the safety bars; it
shimmered through me, a wave of color, blooming past
the gray tenements and toward the narrow sky. I drew
one cold, sweet breath of air and truly understood that I
had arrived in America.

A few days later, I saw Tian. He might have been
to the restaurant a dozen times before, but I do not
remember seeing him until after the music. I noticed
him on a stormy evening near the end of winter. I was
standing at the window, watching the falling snow
make bright flecks in the headlamps of the taxicabs,
when a man appeared in the doorway, carrying a violin
case.

“One person,” he said, in confident English. At
that time, in 1967, many new Chinese had come to live
on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Most of them turned
up at the restaurant, sooner or later. But not many
spoke English with such ease. He wore a brown felt
hat, and his overcoat seemed cut to fit his shoulders;
most of the other men seemed content to wear whatever
would make do.

“Come with me,” I replied, in Mandarin.

I seated him and poured his tea, looking down at
the swirl of leaves in the water. I felt the heat of the
steam in my face, the warm steel handle in my hands; I
watched the tea leaves drift and slide against the blue
and white cup. He thanked me in Chinese. His dark
eyes followed me. For the first time, I felt warm.

Before I left Taiwan, my mother had _ said,
“Beware a man whose cheekbones are too high or low.
Watch out for one who smiles too much.” Her warnings
implied that I had a choice; that these things lay under
my control. But when I was a child she had often talked
about the Chinese myth that every man and every
woman was joined at birth to their mate by an invisible,
enchanted thread. With this story, she said that there
could be no controlling fate.

The man ordered beef noodle soup and drank it
quickly. He had placed his violin case in the opposite
chair, upright and facing him. Then he glanced at his
watch. He flung down a dollar, seized his coat and
violin, and walked out the door. I looked twice to make
sure it was true: he had forgotten his hat on the chair.

To this day I don’t know why I kept Tian’s hat.
Perhaps his solitude gave me strength. I looked around
to make sure no one watched me. Then I slipped over
to his table and picked up the hat, brought it back
behind my counter. He had printed his name inside:
Tian Sung.

Late that night, the man reappeared in the door-
way. I still remember his bare, wet head and sodden
trench coat, creased with snow. He walked over and
stood before me.

“You might have something of mine,” he said, in
Mandarin this time.

“T don’t think so.”

“Would you please take a look?”

I bent and looked under the counter. There was the
hat, where I had put it. I knelt and took it into my

hands. Seconds passed.

I could not give him the hat. My hands grew cold;
I could not breathe. I looked at him. The storm had

streaked his hair into his eyes—surely the blackest eyes
of any man I’d ever met, the eyelashes laid flat with
melting snow. They held an expression of deep and
painful privacy. And at that moment I believed I knew
what would come to be. When I returned the hat, I
would exchange it for the man who wore it. My senses
opened; I grew large. I believed I heard, in the howling
wind, a voice of admonition, but in the end I listened to
the plunge and whistle of my blood. I put the hat into
his beautiful, long-fingered hands.

again.

Passage Il

SOCIAL SCIENCE: Passage A is adapted from an essay by
Alan Williams. Passage B is adapted from an essay by Joan
Simon. Both essays are from the book Alice Guy Blaché:
Cinema Pioneer (©2009 by the Whitney Museum of American
Art and Yale University).

Passage A by Alan Williams

Alice Guy, later Guy Blaché, has fascinated film
critics and historians since the publication of her
memoir in 1976, eight years after her death and more
than fifty years after her last activities as a professional
filmmaker. Guy is a compelling figure for several rela-
tively distinct reasons. There are very few obvious,
clear “firsts” in film history. But Guy was definitely,
unquestionably the first woman filmmaker in the his-
tory of cinema. Guy had wanted, with her memoir, to
reestablish her position in film history, and this is
exactly what happened in the archives after 1976. For it
turns out that many of her films were there all the time,
but had not been identified as hers. This was and is the
fate of most early filmmakers. Film prints had a dis-
tressing tendency to lose beginnings and endings with
repeated showing, and directors were almost never
identified in the initial titles that did survive. But armed
with her book, and with a list she provided researchers
of the films that she could remember making, it has
been possible to put her name to many “orphan” prints.

But her importance goes well beyond her films: a
second way in which she is a compelling figure is her
decisive participation in the elaboration of film produc-
tion as an organized, industrial process. When cinema
first appeared as a for-profit enterprise, filmmaking fol-
lowed an artisanal model. Louis Lumiére, who first
clearly demonstrated the commercial possibilities of the
new medium, trained his operators to photograph his
cinematographer’s celebrated “views,” to develop them
and make positive contact prints, and to project them to
a paying audience: all the work of one person, with a
single machine. George Méliés made more elaborate
works, but he also did almost everything himself: he
was scriptwriter, set designer, cinematographer, publi-
cist, and star. When Guy proposed to Léon Gaumont
that his company make its own films, and that she do
the job, she did most work herself, assisted by a camera
operator. By the time she left the company ten years
later, in 1907, production had been organized, and Guy
was, in modern terms, the company’s head of produc-
tion. She hired, oversaw, and coordinated the work of
set designers, directors, actors, and so forth, though she
herself continued to direct her own films.

Passage B by Joan Simon

Alice Guy’s confidence in her ability to write a
story was one of the factors in Léon Gaumont’s grant-
ing her permission to make her first film. As she said,
“In the beginning, everyone was always shooting street
scenes, parades or moving trains, which I did not find
terribly interesting. So one day I said to Monsieur
Gaumont: ‘It seems to me we could do something

better.” Gaumont and Lumiére were both inventors, and
they were not interested in developing new possibili-
ties. They were content with their technical achieve-
ment. Gaumont said to me: ‘OK ... if you would like
to... it’s a young girl’s thing! You want to make a
film. You want to do something. Have you written a
story?’, ‘Yes, I can write a story; I think I’m capable of
doing something.’” Like many young people to this day
who work at a second job to explore their independent
creative work apart from the more quotidian ways of
earning a living, Guy followed up Gaumont’s permis-
sion by working a second shift. And so, at the age of
twenty-three, by her own account, Alice Guy made her
first film, La Fée aux choux (The Cabbage Fairy).

The complexities of specifically dating her first
film have puzzled historians. A more fundamental ques-
tion seems to be this: how would a young woman, with
no experience, have thought to suggest making a film,
and one with a story? The short answer is that she asked
and that Gaumont already had confidence in her admin-
istrative skills. The slightly longer version is that
Gaumont had little reason to say no. Guy assured
Gaumont that her filmmaking would not interfere with
her secretarial chores. Moreover, what she proposed
didn’t yet exist. At the time Gaumont saw motion-
picture filmmaking as an adjunct to selling cameras,
and the thought of projected motion pictures being a
commercial endeavor as popular entertainment was not
yet on the horizon. This “young girl’s thing”—what he
may have meant by this specifically is not clear—seems
to refer to something apart from the other uses of the
motion-picture and other cameras, the scientific demon-
strations, for example, in which Guy herself as well as
Gaumont had taken part. Indeed, had commercial
potential been envisioned permission might not have
been so easily granted to her.

Questions 11-15 ask about Passage A.

11.

It can reasonably be inferred from Passage A that the
organized industrial process of filmmaking differed
from the artisanal model in that artisanal filmmaking
was accomplished through the work of:

A. a head of production and numerous film crew
artists.

B. one person doing almost all of the film production
jobs.

C. one set designer and a company owner.

D. a publicist, a scriptwriter, and a star.

Passage Ill

HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the book Martha
Graham: A Dancer's Life by Russell Freedman (©1998 by
Russell Freedman). Denishawn refers to the Denishawn
School of Dancing, where Graham was once a student.

In 1926, Martha Graham’s first company, billed as
“Martha Graham and Dance Group,” made its debut.
Most of the dances, with titles like The Three Gopi
Maidens and Maid with the Flaxen Hair, were reminis-
cent of her Denishawn days, though there were sparks
of freshness and originality. Newspaper critics found
Martha and her trio of dancers “decorative, pretty and
undisturbing.” Graham herself would later describe
those early dances as “childish things, dreadful.”

In the next few years her dances would prove
daring and innovative. From 1926 through 1930 she
created seventy-nine new dances for herself and her
Dance Group.

In 1927 she stunned her audience with a short solo
called Revolt, a dance that was anything but “decora-
tive, pretty and undisturbing.” Revolt was Martha’s
first dance of social protest, a stark, forceful comment
on injustice and the outraged human spirit.

The 1920s were a decade of experimentation in all
the arts—in painting, music, literature, and the the-
ater—and a new breed of young dancers wanted to
speak for the changing times in which they lived.
While they respected classical ballet as an art, they felt
that it could never say enough about the pressing con-
cerns of contemporary life.

Classical ballet dated back more than three hun-
dred years to its origins as an elegant spectacle in the
royal courts of Europe. With its five basic positions of
the feet, prescribed positions of the body, and geomet-
ric relationships among the dancers, ballet was a highly
controlled dance form.

To the rebellious young American dancers of the
time, traditional European ballet seemed decadent and
undemocratic. They regarded its dashing princes and
dying swans as escapist and antiquated, and its elabo-
rate formal technique as artificial and restricting. In
place of ballet’s fanciful stories they explored serious
themes dealing with ordinary people and modern life.
They did away with glamorous costumes and scenery
and danced in simple outfits on bare stages. Their
dances were meant to be challenging and disturbing.

In 1929 Martha Graham and Dance Group gave
the first performance of Heretic, regarded today as her
earliest major work. Dressed in white, and with loose,
flowing hair, Martha danced in opposition to a double
row of women clad in black Puritan garb, their hair
drawn straight back and knotted, their stern faces set
like white masks. Again and again the solitary heretic
struggles to advance, trying to break through a barrier
formed by the women in black. But each time they
move rigidly in unison, blocking her way like automa-
tons, as their bare feet slam down onto the floor. Some

of the dancers lunge at the heretic, some seem to be
spitting at her, while others turn their backs. Heretic
was meant to be provocative. The dance can be seen as
a powerful condemnation of intolerance, especially
toward people who are different in some way—a theme
that Graham would return to again. “To many people, I
was a heretic,” she wrote. “In many ways, I showed
onstage what most people came to the theater to
avoid.”

This new kind of dance wasn’t to everyone’s
liking. It was neither beautiful nor romantic. Some crit-
ics complained that Graham’s spare, stark, unsmiling
dance style seemed tortured and distorted.

Martha and her fellow “modern” dancers were
often the butt of ridicule and hostile jokes. Women in
America had won the right to vote only a few years ear-
lier, in 1920, and many people were still uncomfortable
with the image of the “new woman” who sought a
career, spoke out on social issues, and went knowl-
edgeably to the polls. It was all right to be a high-
kicking, scantily clad chorus girl, but a woman who ran a
dance company and created works that commented on
war, poverty, and intolerance seemed unnatural and
suspicious.

Martha’s work was so startlingly different, people
did not always know how to react. After one of her
early recitals, a friend from her Denishawn days went
backstage and said, “Martha, dear, how long do you
expect to keep up this dreadful dancing?”

“As long as I have an audience,” Martha replied.

Graham’s last complete work, composed when she
was ninety-six years old, is one of her most joyful.
Maple Leaf Rag, a self-mocking commentary on human
foibles and on her own legend, is set to the ragtime
tunes of Scott Joplin. At the time of her death, she was
working on a new dance, commissioned by the govern-
ment of Spain.

“Many people have asked me if I have a favorite
role,” Graham once said. “To which I always answer
that my favorite role is the one I am dancing now.”

Which of the following statements best describes the
nature of this passage?

A. A biographical sketch that gives nearly equal
attention to both Graham’s work and her personal
life

B. A chronological account of Graham’s life begin-
ning with her early childhood and ending with her
Denishawn days

C. A description of Graham’s work and philosophy
that focuses on placing her early dances into his-
torical context

D. A depiction of Graham’s philosophy of dance and
how that philosophy had come to be seen as out-
dated by the time of her death

Passage IV

NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article
“When Birds of a Feather Mob Together, It's Usually Bad News
for Predators” by Mariette Nowak (©2000 by National Wildlife
Magazine).

Ornithologist Millicent Ficken was recording bird
calls in Arizona’s Chiricahua Mountains when she
heard the screams of a Cooper’s hawk on a nearby pon-
derosa pine. “After the hawk’s last scream, a Steller’s
jay sounded the alarm with its harsh wah call,” recalls
Ficken. Seconds later, a half-dozen jays were flocking
about the hawk, darting in close to its back and head,
and joining in a raucous chorus of wahs. Then one of
the jays, despite being half the size of its target, struck
the hawk on its back and sent the raptor plummeting to
the ground. The hawk stood there briefly and then flew
off.

Zoologists call this massing together of birds to
attack a common enemy “mobbing.” In this case, the
jays were mobbing a hawk that specializes in eating
birds their size. A widespread phenomenon among
birds, mobbing may involve a mix of bird species or, as
with the jays, just one species attacking a predator.
Rarely, however, do the birds actually strike the object
of their wrath; the jay’s attack was the only instance
that Ficken, a professor emerita at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, has witnessed in more than
20 years of research.

In many cases, mobbing is a noisy affair in which
each species uses its own special calls to bring out its
allies. By surveying the mobbing calls of more than
50 species of birds, Ficken has provided additional
insights into this behavior. “I discovered that there is
no one stereotypic pattern to the calls as had been pre-
viously believed, but an array of different vocalizations
among the various species of birds,” she says.

Earlier research had suggested that mobbing calls
enabled other birds to locate the bird sounding the
alarm. Such calls would start abruptly and cover a wide
range of frequencies, so they could be readily picked
up by other birds. “The black-capped chickadee’s mob-
bing call is a classic example of this type,” says Ficken.
But she discovered that less than half the species she
studied conformed to this classic pattern.

Among other species, she found different kinds of
mobbing calls. Some flock associates—birds that often
hang out together—have mobbing calls unique to their
groups. “Brown creepers, golden-crowned kinglets and
Mexican chickadees, for instance, are frequent flock
associates,” says Ficken, “and their high-pitched, buzzy
mobbing calls are strikingly similar.” Bridled titmice
and ruby-crowned kinglets give mobbing calls that are
nearly identical. “The similarity in their calls may help
to coordinate the group mobbing responses,” she adds.

Her research has also revealed some similarities
within groups of birds with a common ancestry such as
corvids (crows and jays), nuthatches and vireos. But

ACT-GOt

underscoring the complexities of the avian world, she
found that the mobbing calls within other related
groups of birds such as flycatchers and chickadees
were very different. Why the variation? “There are
many possible reasons, such as differences in ancestry
and flock associations,” says Ficken. “But we really
don’t know. It’s a poorly understood area.”

Despite the differences in calls, however, the main
function of mobbing appears to be to get the predator to
move out of the vicinity. Stanley Temple, a wildlife
ecologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, sees
evidence for this theory in his observations as a fal-
coner. On one occasion, one of his red-tailed hawks
caught a crow and brought it to the ground. The
screaming of the captured crow sounded the alarm for
the crows in a huge nearby roost and “they descended
like a black tornado on the hawk,” Temple recalls, and
the captured crow got away.

Ficken’s observations also bear out the “move
along” hypothesis. The Steller’s jays she watched in
Arizona certainly sent the Cooper’s hawk on its way in
a hurry. With its initial mobbing call, the first jay also
put other jays on the alert, averting any surprise attacks
by the hawk—another likely reason for mobbing.

One thing about mobbing is clear: It helps little
birds even the odds against big predators. Ficken
recently observed this in Arizona, where she saw five
hummingbirds mob and chase away a northern pygmy-
owl more than three times their size. Says Ficken:
“Even small prey species can defeat their larger ene-
mies by mass action.”

Which of the following statements is NOT supported
by the passage?

A. Brown creepers, nuthatches, and Steller’s jays
share a common ancestry.

B. Ficken has been witnessing mobbing incidents for
at least 20 years.

C. Temple has made observations that support the
“move along hypothesis.”

D. Ficken’s research disproves an earlier belief that

mobbing calls conformed to one stereotypic
pattern.

It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the
average life span of members of a small-bird species is
increased by the birds’ ability to:

F. travel with large predators.

G. eat birds their own size.

H. avoid contact with flock associates.
J. participate in mass action.

What is the function of the first two paragraphs (lines
1-23) in relation to the passage as a whole?

A. To introduce the idea that Cooper’s hawks special-
ize in eating Steller’s jays and are the most common
predators in mobbing incidents

B. To identify Ficken as the leading authority on mob-
bing and highlight her credentials and background

C. To provide a definition of mobbing and illustrate
an unusual example of it
To present the opposing points of view held by
ornithologists and zoologists on a widespread phe-
nomenon among birds

According to the passage, the Steller’s jay’s initial
mobbing call resulted in all of the following EXCEPT
that it:

F. signaled other jays to flock around the predator.

G._ put other jays on the alert.

H. motivated the Cooper’s hawk’s raucous chorus of
screams.

J. prevented surprise attacks by the predator.

When Temple compares the flock of crows mobbing
the red-tailed hawk to a “black tornado” (line 69), he
illustrates a point made earlier in the passage that:

1. Based on

ientist 3’s viewpoint, which of the follow-

Mass extinctions on Earth may be caused by bombard-
ments of Earth by comets from the Qort cloud, a spherical
swarm of comets occupying the outer part of our solar
system. Three scientists share their viewpoints about possi-
ble causes of the bombardments.

Scientist 1

The Sun is orbited by a dim, unseen object called a
brown dwarf, an object that is less than 0.08 times the
Sun’s mass and therefore is not massive enough to become
a star. Each complete orbit of the brown dwarf takes
26 million years. Once each orbit, the brown dwarf passes
through the Oort cloud. The brown dwarf’s gravitational
force alters the orbits of many comets, causing | or more
of them to enter the inner part of the solar system and to
collide with Earth, producing a mass extinction.

Scientist 2

The Sun is part of an open cluster, a type of star clus-
ter in which the stars are bound to each other by gravity.
The Sun revolves around the center of mass of the cluster
once every 26 million years. Once every orbit, the Sun
passes through the densest part of the cluster. The gravita-
tional force exerted by the stars in this part of the cluster
causes many comets to leave the Oort cloud. One or more
of these comets enter the inner part of our solar system and
collide with Earth, causing a mass extinction.

Scientist 3

Our galaxy is disk shaped, and the Sun lies within the
disk. The galaxy also contains high-velocity stars, stars
following orbits that are highly inclined with respect to the
disk. The bombardments that produce mass extinctions are
caused by the gravitational effects of high-velocity stars.
High-velocity stars cause bombardments whenever these
stars pass near the Oort cloud. This hypothesis is prefer-
able because, rather than occurring every 26 million years,
mass extinctions occur at irregular intervals. Moreover, the
Sun cannot be part of an open cluster, because the Sun is
5 billion years old. The stars in open clusters all form at
approximately the same time and then drift apart after a
few hundred million years.

years ago. Based on Scientist 1’s viewpoint, the next
mass extinction would most likely occur how many
million years from now?

A. 5
B. 13
C. 26
D. 32

4. Scientist 1 implies that the unseen object might be
observable from Earth if the object:

F._orbited the center of an open cluster instead of the
center of our galaxy.

orbited the center of our galaxy instead of the
center of an open cluster.

H. were a star instead of a brown dwarf.

Passage Il

A study was conducted to identify the properties of a
type of sand being mined at a given site. Natural processes
bring this sand to the mining site from 1 of 4 possible
sources, all located within a few miles of the site: a river,
inland dunes, underwater offshore dunes, or a beach to the
north (see Figure 1). A second study examined sand from
each of these possible sources to determine which of the
sources supplies sand to the mining site.

Study 1

Samples of the mined sand were collected at the
mining site by taking a 2.5 cm diameter core 30 cm deep at
3 locations, 1 m apart. All organic matter, and all clay, silt,
and gravel, were separated from the samples, leaving only
sand-size particles (0.0625—2 mm in diameter). The col-
oration of each particle and the average diameter of the
particles were determined. A thin layer of the sand was
glued to a glass slide, ground down until it was only
25 micrometers thick, and then examined under magnifica-
tion using transmitted polarized light to determine the
composition of each particle. The results are in Table 1.

Study 2

The process of collecting and analyzing sand samples
described in Study | was repeated at the 4 sites that were

Passage VI

Parcel lapse rate is the measured air temperature
change per unit distance for a parcel of rising air. Figure |
shows the temperature versus the altitude for a particular
dry air parcel and a particular moist air parcel. If the atmo-
sphere around a parcel decreases in temperature with alti-
tude at a rate greater than that of the parcel itself, the
parcel may, at some altitude, be warmer than the surround-
ing atmosphere. In this case, the parcel will continue to rise
from that altitude, increasing the probability of strong
storms. Figure 2 shows, for a given location, the tempera- 0
ture versus the altitude for 4 parcels of dry air, each of temperature (°C)
which began to rise at a different time on a particular day.

Explanation of Procedures Used to Obtain
Scale Scores from Raw Scores

On each of the four tests on which you marked any
responses, the total number of correct responses yields a raw
score. Use the table below to convert your raw scores to scale
scores. For each test, locate and circle your raw score or the
range of raw scores that includes it in the table below. Then,
read across to either outside column of the table and circle the
scale score that corresponds to that raw score. As you
determine your scale scores, enter them in the blanks provided
on the right. The highest possible scale score for each test is
36. The lowest possible scale score for any test on which you
marked any responses is 1.

Next, compute the Composite score by averaging the four
scale scores. To do this, add your four scale scores and divide
the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it
off to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less
than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)
Enter this number in the blank. This is your Composite score.
The highest possible Composite score is 36. The lowest
possible Composite score is 1.

NOTE: If you left a test completely blank and marked no items,
do not list a scale score for that test. If any test was completely
